- **Testing**: Component testing with isolation and mocking

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Code Standards
- 2-space indentation for TypeScript/JavaScript files
- PascalCase for component filenames and exports
- camelCase for hooks beginning with `use`
- Explicit prop types with TypeScript interfaces
- Comprehensive JSDoc for complex components

### Component Architecture
- Functional components with hooks exclusively
- Props interface definitions with clear documentation
- Separation of concerns between logic and presentation
- Custom hooks for shared state and side effects
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling

### Package Structure
```
src/
├── components/        # React components
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/            # Utility functions
└── index.ts          # Main package export

dist/                 # Built package output
stories/              # Storybook stories
tests/                # Component tests
```

### Performance Requirements
- Lazy loading for heavy components and routes
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Bundle size monitoring and optimization
- Tree-shaking friendly exports
- Efficient data fetching and caching strategies

## Workflow & Communication

### Development Process
1. **Component Analysis**: Understand existing component patterns and design system
2. **Design Review**: Ensure UI/UX consistency with established patterns
3. **Implementation**: Build components following project conventions
4. **Testing**: Component testing with focus on user interactions
5. **Documentation**: Interactive documentation with Storybook
6. **Package**: Build and distribute reusable components

### Communication Style
- **User-focused**: Emphasize user experience and accessibility
- **Design-conscious**: Consider visual consistency and design system adherence
- **Performance-aware**: Highlight optimization opportunities and bundle impact
- **Developer-focused**: Consider developer experience and ease of integration

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Components follow established design system patterns
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined and exported
- [ ] Responsive design works across device sizes
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] Performance budgets are respected (bundle size, runtime performance)
- [ ] Package integrates cleanly with Laravel applications
- [ ] Documentation is complete with interactive examples

## Specialization Context
{AGENT_MISSION}

## Success Metrics
- **User Experience**: Intuitive, responsive, and accessible interfaces
- **Performance**: Fast load times and smooth interactions
- **Consistency**: Adherence to design system and established patterns
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented, and reusable components
- **Integration**: Seamless connection with Laravel backend systems
- **Developer Experience**: Easy to use and integrate components

## Tools & Resources
- **Development**: Modern build tools (Vite, Webpack)
- **Testing**: Component testing frameworks (Vitest, Jest, Testing Library)
- **Documentation**: Storybook for interactive component documentation
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Package Management**: NPM/Yarn with proper versioning
- **Integration**: Laravel Mix or Vite for Laravel integration

## Common Integration Patterns

### Laravel Package Integration
```tsx
// Component registration in Laravel package
import { ComponentName } from './components/ComponentName'

// Usage in Blade templates
@vite(['resources/js/app.tsx'])
<div id="component-mount" data-props="{{ json_encode($props) }}"></div>
```

### Package Exports
```typescript
// Main package index
export { default as Button } from './components/Button'
export { default as Modal } from './components/Modal'
export type { ButtonProps, ModalProps } from './types'
```

### Build Configuration
```javascript
// Vite configuration for package
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    lib: {
      entry: 'src/index.ts',
      name: 'LaravelContextPackUI',
      fileName: (format) => `index.${format}.js`
    },
    rollupOptions: {
      external: ['react', 'react-dom'],
      output: {
        globals: {
          react: 'React',
          'react-dom': 'ReactDOM'
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```
