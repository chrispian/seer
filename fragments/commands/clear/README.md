# Clear Command - YAML Migration

## Migration Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Migrated from hardcoded PHP to YAML DSL

## Original Implementation
```php
// app/Actions/Commands/ClearCommand.php
return new CommandResponse(type: 'clear');
```

## New YAML Implementation
```yaml
# fragments/commands/clear/command.yaml
steps:
  - id: clear-chat
    type: notify
    with:
      message: ""
      level: "info"
      response_data:
        type: "clear"
        shouldResetChat: false
```

## Migration Pattern Established

### 1. **Response Data Handling**
- Used `response_data` in notify step to control response properties
- Enhanced NotifyStep to support response_data parameter
- Updated CommandController to apply response_data properties

### 2. **Command Registration**
- Created command directory: `fragments/commands/clear/`
- Added command.yaml with proper structure
- Registered in database via CommandRegistry model

### 3. **Hardcoded Removal**
- Commented out hardcoded entry in CommandRegistry.php
- Verified YAML version works through full controller flow

### 4. **Testing Approach**
- Tested DSL loading and execution independently
- Tested full controller flow with actual request
- Verified response format matches original

## Key DSL Features Used
- ✅ **notify step** - Basic notification/response handling
- ✅ **response_data** - Custom response property control
- ✅ **Enhanced template engine** - Ready for complex expressions
- ✅ **Command registration** - Database-backed command discovery

## Next Commands
This pattern can be applied to other simple commands:
- `help` - Static content with dynamic command list
- `name` - Basic text operations

The clear command establishes the foundation for systematic command migration.
