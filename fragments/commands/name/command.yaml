      # Set Channel Name

      Usage:
      - `/name My Project Chat` – Set custom name for current channel
      - `/name #ProjectAlpha` – Set name (# is optional)

      The current channel will be renamed and the new name will appear in the sidebar.

      **Current naming:**
      - Short code: Always preserved (e.g., `#c5`)
      - Custom name: Replaces the auto-generated title
      - Display format: `#c5 Your Custom Name`

      **Note:** Full name command functionality is being migrated. This help is available while migration is in progress.
