# ENG-09-01: Tool SDK & Registry Foundation - Implementation Plan

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Core Interface and Contract Design (3-4 hours)
**Objective**: Establish the foundational interfaces and contracts that all tools will implement

**Deliverables**:
- `ToolContract` interface with standardized method signatures
- Base tool implementation class with common functionality
- JSON schema validation patterns and helper methods
- Tool scope and permission enumeration

**Key Tasks**:
- Design `ToolContract` interface with execute, validate, getSchema methods
- Create `AbstractTool` base class with telemetry hooks
- Implement JSON schema validation using existing Fragment patterns
- Define tool scope constants (read, write, admin, system)
- Create tool version management interface

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] ToolContract interface supports all planned tool types
- [ ] JSON schema validation works with complex nested inputs
- [ ] Scope system supports granular permission control
- [ ] Version management enables backward compatibility

### Phase 2: Tool Registry and Discovery (4-5 hours)
**Objective**: Build the registry system that discovers, loads, and manages tool implementations

**Deliverables**:
- `ToolRegistry` class with dynamic tool discovery
- Service provider integration for Laravel container
- Caching layer for performance optimization
- Tool metadata and documentation system

**Key Tasks**:
- Implement automatic tool discovery in `app/Tools/` directory
- Create registry caching with Laravel cache integration
- Build tool metadata aggregation (schemas, scopes, versions)
- Implement tool resolution and dependency injection
- Add registry health checks and validation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Registry automatically discovers new tools on deployment
- [ ] Tool lookup performance meets < 5ms requirement
- [ ] Caching reduces repeated file system operations
- [ ] Registry validates tool implementations on registration

### Phase 3: Telemetry and Monitoring Middleware (2-3 hours)
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive telemetry capture for all tool executions

**Deliverables**:
- `ToolTelemetry` middleware for execution tracking
- Metrics collection and storage integration
- Performance monitoring and alerting hooks
- Privacy-conscious data hashing and storage

**Key Tasks**:
- Create middleware to wrap tool execution automatically
- Implement metrics collection (duration, success/failure, sizes)
- Add input/output hashing for audit trails
- Integrate with Laravel logging and metrics systems
- Build telemetry data aggregation and reporting

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All tool executions automatically generate telemetry
- [ ] Sensitive data is hashed before storage
- [ ] Performance overhead stays under 2ms per execution
- [ ] Telemetry integrates with existing monitoring systems

### Phase 4: Configuration and Scoping System (2-3 hours)
**Objective**: Build flexible configuration system for tool scopes, quotas, and permissions

**Deliverables**:
- `config/tools.php` configuration file with comprehensive options
- Scope validation and permission checking system
- Quota enforcement and rate limiting integration
- Environment-based configuration overrides

**Key Tasks**:
- Design configuration schema for scopes, quotas, and tool settings
- Implement permission checking against user roles and tool scopes
- Create quota enforcement with Redis-based rate limiting
- Build configuration validation and error handling
- Add environment-specific overrides and testing configurations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Configuration supports granular per-tool and per-user settings
- [ ] Scope validation prevents unauthorized tool access
- [ ] Quota system prevents resource abuse
- [ ] Configuration validation catches invalid settings

### Phase 5: Testing Framework and Documentation (2-3 hours)
**Objective**: Ensure comprehensive testing coverage and complete documentation

**Deliverables**:
- Complete test suite covering all registry functionality
- Performance and security test scenarios
- Developer documentation and integration guides
- Tool development examples and templates

**Key Tasks**:
- Write unit tests for all registry and contract functionality
- Create integration tests for end-to-end tool execution
- Implement performance benchmarks and security tests
- Write comprehensive developer documentation
- Create example tool implementations and templates

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 95% for all core functionality
- [ ] Performance tests validate sub-10ms execution requirements
- [ ] Documentation enables independent tool development
- [ ] Example implementations demonstrate best practices

## Dependencies and Sequencing

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Phase 1** must complete before any other phase (foundational interfaces)
2. **Phase 2** depends on Phase 1 (registry needs contracts)
3. **Phase 3** depends on Phase 2 (telemetry needs registry)
4. **Phase 4** can run parallel with Phase 3 (independent configuration)
5. **Phase 5** depends on all previous phases (testing needs complete system)

### External Dependencies
- **Laravel Framework**: Version 12 service container patterns
- **JSON Schema Libraries**: For input/output validation
- **Redis Cache**: For performance optimization and rate limiting
- **Existing Auth System**: For user permission integration

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Impact**: Tool discovery and validation overhead
  - *Mitigation*: Aggressive caching and lazy loading patterns
- **Memory Usage**: Registry holding many tool definitions
  - *Mitigation*: Lazy tool loading and memory-efficient caching

### Integration Risks
- **Existing System Conflicts**: Tool system interfering with current functionality
  - *Mitigation*: Isolated namespace and optional feature flags
- **Database Performance**: Additional telemetry data storage
  - *Mitigation*: Async telemetry processing and data retention policies

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- Registry can discover and load 20+ tools without performance degradation
- Tool execution telemetry captures 100% of invocations
- Configuration system supports complex scoping and quota scenarios
- Developer documentation enables tool creation in < 2 hours

### Performance Metrics
- Tool registry lookup: < 5ms (target: 2ms)
- Schema validation: < 10ms per tool (target: 5ms)
- Telemetry overhead: < 2ms per execution (target: 1ms)
- Memory usage: < 50MB for full registry (target: 25MB)

### Quality Metrics
- Test coverage: > 95% (target: 100%)
- Documentation completeness: All APIs documented
- Security validation: All scope and permission scenarios tested
- Performance benchmarks: All targets met under load

## Integration Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation (Phases 1-2)
- Days 1-2: Interface design and contract implementation
- Days 3-4: Registry system and discovery implementation
- Day 5: Integration testing and performance validation

### Week 2: Telemetry and Configuration (Phases 3-5)
