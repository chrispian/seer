## Task Overview
**Task ID**: ENG-09-03  
**Sprint**: 47  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours  
**Complexity**: Medium

## Agent Assignment
**Primary Agent**: Performance Engineer + DSL Framework Specialist  
**Skills Required**:
- Performance analysis and benchmarking
- Laravel application optimization

## Task Description
Conduct comprehensive performance analysis of the migrated command system to validate production readiness and identify optimization opportunities. This analysis supports strategic decisions for the remaining complex command migrations.

## Analysis Objectives

### **1. Migration Performance Validation**
Compare migrated YAML DSL commands against original hardcoded implementations to ensure performance targets are met or exceeded.

### **2. DSL Framework Optimization**
Identify bottlenecks in the DSL execution pipeline and implement targeted optimizations for production deployment.

### **3. System Scalability Assessment**
Evaluate the performance characteristics of the unified command system under various load conditions.

### **4. Strategic Performance Planning**
Provide performance insights to guide complex command migration decisions and framework investment.

## Performance Analysis Scope

### **Commands to Benchmark**
**Sprint 46 Migrations**:
- `clear` - Simple response pattern
- `help` - Complex content generation  
- `frag` - Fragment creation workflow
- `recall` - Unified conflict resolution

**Sprint 47 Migrations** (ENG-09-01 & ENG-09-02):
- `todo`, `inbox`, `search` - Unified conflict resolutions
- `bookmark`, `join`, `channels`, `routing`, `session` - Medium-complexity migrations

### **Performance Metrics**
