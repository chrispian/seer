# v0.0.2 Roadmap (Scheduler)

- **Cron & RRULE support** (advanced recurrence).
- **Backoff/retry** policies on failure, with per-schedule max attempts.
- **Jitter** to avoid thundering herd for many 07:00 jobs.
- **Per-workspace overrides** for holidays/blackout windows.
- **Output routing**: email/export fragments to a list, Slack webhook, etc.
- **Secrets integration** for source adapters (`news.fetch` using keys).
- **Observability**: metrics, traces, and error dashboards.
- **UI**: basic list, status badges, next/last run, run history, pause/resume.
