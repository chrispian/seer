# FE Runner Sprint Stubs

This archive contains doc/spec scaffolds, schemas, PHP service stubs, config files, route stubs, and test placeholders
to support the **Quantum Runner** and **OpenHands Attached Runner** plan.

- Place files at the project root (paths preserved).
- Register the command `schemas:validate` in your Console kernel.
- Merge `routes/api.orchestration.stub.php` content into `routes/api.php` manually.
- Configure `config/runners.php`, `config/telemetry.php`, `config/mcp.php` as needed.
- Run tests: `php artisan test` (tests are placeholders).
