# TODO: NativePHP Packaging & Testing

## Phase 1: Extension Bundling ⏱️ 2h

### Extension Acquisition
- [ ] **Download** sqlite-vec extension binaries for all platforms
  - [ ] Windows: sqlite-vec.dll
  - [ ] macOS: sqlite-vec.dylib  
  - [ ] Linux: sqlite-vec.so
- [ ] **Verify** extension compatibility with target SQLite versions
- [ ] **Test** extension loading in development environment

### Build Integration
- [ ] **Add** extension files to NativePHP build resources
- [ ] **Configure** build pipeline to include platform-specific extensions
- [ ] **Update** package.json or build scripts for extension handling
- [ ] **Test** extension inclusion in development builds

## Phase 2: Automatic Loading ⏱️ 1h

### Extension Configuration
- [ ] **Configure** SQLite to automatically load sqlite-vec extension
- [ ] **Add** NativePHP-specific vector configuration
- [ ] **Implement** extension path detection for bundled extensions
- [ ] **Test** automatic loading in packaged app context

### Fallback Handling
- [ ] **Implement** graceful fallback if extension loading fails
- [ ] **Add** logging for extension loading status
- [ ] **Test** fallback to text-only search
- [ ] **Provide** user feedback for missing vector capabilities

## Phase 3: Build Pipeline Integration ⏱️ 1h

### Build Configuration
- [ ] **Update** NativePHP build configuration for vector support
- [ ] **Add** platform-specific build steps for extensions
- [ ] **Configure** CI/CD pipeline for automated builds
- [ ] **Test** builds across Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Validate** extension bundling in all platform builds
- [ ] **Test** app startup and vector initialization
- [ ] **Verify** vector search functionality in packaged apps
- [ ] **Check** performance and resource usage

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation ⏱️ 1-2h

### Functional Testing
- [ ] **Test** vector search functionality in packaged desktop app
- [ ] **Validate** embedding and search performance
- [ ] **Test** offline functionality (no external dependencies)
- [ ] **Verify** graceful degradation when vector unavailable

### Performance Testing
- [ ] **Benchmark** search performance in desktop environment
- [ ] **Test** memory usage and resource consumption
- [ ] **Validate** app startup time with vector extensions
- [ ] **Compare** performance vs web deployment

### Cross-Platform Testing
- [ ] **Test** Windows build with vector functionality
- [ ] **Test** macOS build with vector functionality  
- [ ] **Test** Linux build with vector functionality
- [ ] **Validate** consistent behavior across platforms

### Documentation
- [ ] **Create** deployment guide for vector-enabled NativePHP builds
- [ ] **Document** troubleshooting procedures for extension issues
- [ ] **Write** performance tuning guide for desktop deployment
- [ ] **Create** user guide for vector search features

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] sqlite-vec extension loads automatically in NativePHP builds
- [ ] Vector search works offline in desktop application
- [ ] Graceful fallback to text search when vector unavailable
