- [ ] Optimize query performance for command discovery

### **3.3 Service Provider Cleanup**
- [ ] Remove CommandRegistry service bindings
- [ ] Clean up command-related service registrations
- [ ] Update dependency injection configurations
- [ ] Validate service provider consistency

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization (2-3 hours)

### **4.1 Command Loading Optimization**
- [ ] Implement intelligent command caching with Redis
- [ ] Add command preloading for frequently used commands
- [ ] Optimize command metadata loading
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for command details

### **4.2 Database Optimization**
- [ ] Add index on `command_registry.slug`
- [ ] Add index on `command_registry.reserved`
- [ ] Add composite indexes for common queries
- [ ] Optimize command lookup queries

### **4.3 DSL Framework Optimization**
- [ ] Optimize DSL step execution performance
- [ ] Implement template compilation caching
- [ ] Add workflow result caching where appropriate
- [ ] Optimize context building and variable resolution

### **4.4 Caching Strategy Implementation**
- [ ] Implement Redis caching for command data
- [ ] Add cache warming strategies
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation logic
- [ ] Monitor cache hit rates and performance

## Phase 5: Comprehensive Testing & Validation (1-2 hours)

### **5.1 Regression Testing**
- [ ] Test all migrated commands for functionality
- [ ] Validate response formats and data structures
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Validate alias functionality

### **5.2 Integration Testing**
- [ ] Test frontend command execution through ChatIsland
- [ ] Validate CommandResultModal functionality
- [ ] Test autocomplete integration and performance
- [ ] Validate API endpoint functionality

### **5.3 Performance Testing**
- [ ] Benchmark command execution times (target: 10-20% improvement)
- [ ] Test system performance under load
- [ ] Validate memory usage improvements (target: 15-25% reduction)
- [ ] Test database query performance

### **5.4 API Compatibility Testing**
- [ ] Test `/api/commands/execute` endpoint
- [ ] Test `/api/autocomplete/commands` endpoint
- [ ] Validate response format consistency
- [ ] Test error responses and status codes

## Phase 6: Monitoring & Documentation (1 hour)

### **6.1 Monitoring Implementation**
