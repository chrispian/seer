# System Cleanup & Optimization Context

## Current System State

After completing ENG-08-01, ENG-08-02, and ENG-08-03, the system should have:
- All 18 hardcoded commands migrated to YAML DSL
- Enhanced DSL framework with new step types
- Resolved conflicts between dual implementations
- Comprehensive test coverage for all commands

## Cleanup Objectives

### 1. Remove Dual Command System
The system currently maintains both hardcoded and file-based command execution paths. After migration, the hardcoded system should be completely removed:

#### Current Dual Architecture
```php
// CommandController.php - Current dual lookup
try {
    // First: Try hardcoded commands
    $commandClass = CommandRegistry::find($commandName);
    $commandInstance = app($commandClass);
    $response = $commandInstance->handle($commandRequest);
} catch (\InvalidArgumentException $e) {
    // Fallback: Try file-based commands
    $dbCommand = CommandRegistryModel::where('slug', $commandName)->first();
    if ($dbCommand) {
        $runner = app(CommandRunner::class);
        $result = $runner->execute($commandName, $arguments);
    }
}
```

#### Target Unified Architecture
```php
// CommandController.php - Unified file-based lookup
$dbCommand = CommandRegistryModel::where('slug', $commandName)->first();
if ($dbCommand) {
    $runner = app(CommandRunner::class);
    $result = $runner->execute($commandName, $arguments);
} else {
    throw new \InvalidArgumentException("Command not found: {$commandName}");
}
```

### 2. Legacy Code Removal

#### Files to Remove
- `app/Services/CommandRegistry.php` (hardcoded command registry)
- All files in `app/Actions/Commands/` (18 hardcoded command classes)
- Related test files for hardcoded commands
- Unused imports and dependencies

#### Files to Update
- `app/Http/Controllers/CommandController.php` (remove dual lookup)
- `app/Http/Controllers/AutocompleteController.php` (file-based command discovery)
- Frontend autocomplete system (if needed)
- Related service providers and configurations

### 3. System Optimization

#### Command Loading Optimization
- Optimize command discovery and caching
- Improve CommandPackLoader performance
- Enhance command registry database queries
- Implement intelligent command preloading

#### DSL Framework Optimization
- Optimize step execution and workflow processing
- Implement step result caching where appropriate
- Optimize template engine performance
- Improve error handling and logging

#### Database Optimization
- Optimize command registry table structure
- Add appropriate indexes for command lookup
- Optimize command metadata storage
- Implement command usage analytics
