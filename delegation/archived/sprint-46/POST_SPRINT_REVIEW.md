# Sprint 46 Post-Sprint Review Items

## Complex Command Migration Assessment

### **Key Finding from ENG-08-02**
During the command migration process, we identified a **complexity boundary** where very complex database-heavy commands (like `name`) may be better suited for hybrid approaches rather than pure YAML DSL migration.

### **Commands Requiring Post-Sprint Review**

#### **High Complexity Commands** (Deferred for Review)
1. **`name` Command**
   - **Challenge**: Complex session validation, database updates, context access
   - **Current Status**: Partially migrated (help only)
   - **Recommendation**: Evaluate hybrid approach vs. enhanced DSL

2. **Future Complex Commands** (When encountered)
   - Commands requiring deep Laravel integration
   - Multi-model database operations
   - Complex validation with multiple failure paths
   - Real-time system state management

### **Review Questions for Post-Sprint**

#### **1. DSL vs. Hardcoded Boundary**
- Where should we draw the line between YAML DSL and hardcoded PHP?
- What complexity indicators suggest staying with hardcoded approach?
- How do we maintain consistency while allowing both approaches?

#### **2. Hybrid Approach Exploration**
- Can we create "hybrid commands" that use DSL for common patterns but PHP for complex logic?
- Should we create DSL extensions specifically for complex database operations?
- How do we balance maintainability vs. capability?

#### **3. Long-term Strategy**
- Should we continue expanding DSL capabilities indefinitely?
- What's the ROI threshold for complex DSL development vs. keeping hardcoded commands?
- How do we document and maintain the boundary decisions?

### **Specific Action Items for Review**

#### **Technical Assessment**
- [ ] Analyze remaining complex commands (`vault`, `project`, `context`, `compose`)
- [ ] Define complexity metrics for migration decision-making
- [ ] Prototype hybrid command approach
- [ ] Evaluate DSL framework extension costs vs. benefits

#### **Documentation**
- [ ] Create "Command Complexity Guidelines" for future development
- [ ] Document migration decision tree (DSL vs. hardcoded vs. hybrid)
- [ ] Establish patterns for complex command development

#### **Team Discussion**
- [ ] Review migration outcomes and lessons learned
- [ ] Align on long-term command architecture strategy
- [ ] Decide on investment level for DSL framework expansion

### **Success Criteria from Sprint 46**
âœ… **Proven DSL capability** for simple-to-medium commands  
âœ… **Established migration patterns** for systematic approach  
âœ… **Identified complexity boundary** for informed decision-making  
ðŸ”„ **Complex command strategy** requires post-sprint review and team alignment

### **Recommendation**
Schedule a **Command Architecture Review** session post-Sprint 46 to:
1. Review migration outcomes and establish long-term strategy
2. Define complexity boundaries and decision criteria
3. Align team on hybrid vs. pure DSL vs. hardcoded approaches
4. Plan investment in DSL framework extensions based on actual needs

This review will ensure we make informed architectural decisions rather than purely technical ones, considering maintainability, team productivity, and long-term system evolution.
