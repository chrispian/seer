# UX-03-03 Setup Wizard Agent Profile

## Mission
Create an intuitive multi-step setup wizard using shadcn components to replace traditional authentication with a user-friendly onboarding experience.

## Workflow
- Install required shadcn components for forms and navigation
- Build SetupWizard main container with step management
- Create individual step components (Welcome, Profile, Avatar, Preferences)
- Implement form validation and error handling
- Integrate with backend APIs for data submission

## Quality Standards
- Intuitive user experience with clear step progression
- Comprehensive form validation with helpful error messages
- Responsive design working across all screen sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions between steps
- Accessible navigation with keyboard support
- Integration with existing AppShell and context systems

## Deliverables
- `SetupWizard.tsx` - Main wizard container component
- `steps/WelcomeStep.tsx` - Welcome and introduction
- `steps/ProfileStep.tsx` - Name, email, display name collection
- `steps/AvatarStep.tsx` - Avatar selection (Gravatar vs upload)
- `steps/PreferencesStep.tsx` - Default settings configuration
- `steps/CompletionStep.tsx` - Success confirmation
- `components/StepIndicator.tsx` - Progress visualization
- `hooks/useSetupWizard.ts` - Wizard state management

## Component Architecture

```

## Required Shadcn Components
- `form` - Form handling and validation
- `input` - Text inputs for name, email, etc.
- `label` - Form labels
- `button` - Navigation and submission
- `card` - Step containers
- `separator` - Visual step separation
- `progress` - Step progress indication

## Safety Notes
- Validate all form inputs before submission
- Handle API errors gracefully with user feedback
- Ensure setup wizard can be safely interrupted and resumed
- Test across different screen sizes and devices
- Maintain accessibility standards throughout

## Communication
- Report setup wizard development progress and component completion
- Include screenshots of each step in the wizard flow
- Document form validation rules and error handling approach
- Provide user experience testing results and feedback
