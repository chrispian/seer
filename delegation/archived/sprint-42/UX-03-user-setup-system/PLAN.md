- Create custom avatar upload with drag-and-drop
- Add image cropping and resizing functionality
- Implement local caching for offline functionality

**Key Deliverables**:
- GravatarPreview component with real-time updates
- AvatarUpload component with drag-and-drop
- Image processing and validation
- Local avatar caching system

## Phase 5: Settings Page Development (UX-03-05)
**Timeline**: 4-6 hours
**Goals**:
- Create comprehensive settings interface
- Implement tabbed navigation for different setting categories
- Add real-time preference updates and persistence
- Design user-friendly preference management

**Key Deliverables**:
- SettingsPage with tabbed interface
- Profile, Preferences, AI, and Appearance settings tabs
- Real-time settings validation and persistence
- Settings import/export preparation

## Dependencies Between Phases
- Phase 2 requires Phase 1 database schema completion
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 backend services
- Phase 4 integrates with both Phase 2 services and Phase 3 wizard
- Phase 5 builds on all previous phases for complete functionality

## Integration Milestones
- **Milestone 1**: Database and backend services operational
- **Milestone 2**: Basic setup wizard functional
- **Milestone 3**: Avatar system fully integrated
- **Milestone 4**: Complete settings management available
- **Milestone 5**: Full system testing and deployment ready

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental database migrations with proper rollback support
- Fallback to default avatar if Gravatar/upload fails
- Graceful degradation for offline avatar functionality
- Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Progressive enhancement approach for complex features

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for backend services and API endpoints
- Integration tests for setup wizard flow completion
- File upload security and validation testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing (Electron context)
- User experience testing with real setup scenarios

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize image processing for avatar uploads
- Efficient Gravatar caching strategy
- Minimize setup wizard loading times
- Responsive settings interface for large preference sets
- Desktop app memory usage optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- Setup wizard completes successfully for new installations
- Profile information persists across application restarts
- Avatar system works reliably with both Gravatar and uploads
- Settings interface provides comprehensive preference management
- Zero breaking changes to existing user sessions
- Professional user experience throughout setup and settings

## Future Enhancement Preparation
- Multi-user support architecture consideration
- Cloud sync preparation for user preferences
- Advanced avatar customization capabilities
- Team/organization settings framework
- Settings backup and restore functionality
