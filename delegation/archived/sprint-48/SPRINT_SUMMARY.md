# Sprint 48: Delegation Workflow â†’ Fragments Engine Migration

**Sprint Goal**: Migrate our current delegation workflow to leverage Fragments Engine agent orchestration capabilities via MCP, making sprint/task management universally available to any Claude Code agent across any project.

**Duration**: 4 weeks (estimated)  
**Dependencies**: ENG-09-01 (Tool SDK), ENG-09-04 (Agent Memory), ENG-09-05 (Prompt Orchestrator), UX-04-02 (Agent Manager)

## Sprint Objectives

### **Primary Goals**
1. **Universal Agent Orchestration**: Enable any Claude Code agent to use Fragments Engine for sprint/task management
2. **Sub-Agent Governance**: Enforce agent profile usage and FE orchestration for all sub-agents
3. **Project Manager Agent**: Implement internal/system agent for request handling and task assignment
4. **Context Migration**: Move from file-based to database-backed with RAG capabilities
5. **Cross-Project Compatibility**: Ensure workflow works across any project type

### **Key Principles**
- **Agent Profile Enforcement**: All sub-agents must use FE agent profiles and orchestration
- **System Agent Coordination**: Internal project manager handles incoming requests and assignment
- **Universal Access**: Any Claude Code instance can leverage FE orchestration
- **Context Preservation**: RAG-searchable task/sprint context for intelligent agent collaboration
- **Non-Destructive Migration**: Maintain current workflow during transition

## Success Metrics

### **Technical Metrics**
- [ ] All delegation commands migrated to MCP calls
- [ ] 7 agent profiles successfully imported to FE
- [ ] System project manager agent operational
- [ ] Context storage and RAG retrieval functional
- [ ] Cross-project sprint management verified

### **Workflow Metrics**
- [ ] Sub-agents consistently use FE orchestration
- [ ] Task assignment automation via project manager
- [ ] Agent handoff workflows operational
- [ ] Sprint creation/management via FE
- [ ] Progress tracking automated

### **User Experience Metrics**
- [ ] Commands work identically from any Claude Code instance
- [ ] Context is preserved and searchable across sprints
- [ ] Agent coordination is seamless and automated
- [ ] Performance equals or exceeds current workflow

## Dependencies & Blockers

### **External Dependencies**
- **ENG-09-01**: Tool SDK Foundation (contracts, registry, telemetry)
- **ENG-09-04**: Agent Memory Foundation (notes, decisions, vectors)
- **ENG-09-05**: Prompt Orchestrator (dynamic prompt assembly)
- **UX-04-02**: Agent Manager System (profiles, modes, avatars)

### **Internal Dependencies**
- Context broker system (referenced in other sprints)
- MCP server infrastructure for FE
- Agent memory MCP server implementation
- Database schema for agent orchestration

## Migration Strategy

### **Phase 1: Foundation** (Week 1)
- Update dependencies and confirm readiness
- Create MCP integration layer
- Set up basic agent profile migration

### **Phase 2: Core Migration** (Week 2)
- Migrate agent profiles to FE system
- Implement system project manager agent
- Begin command migration

### **Phase 3: Workflow Integration** (Week 3)
- Complete command migration
- Integrate context and memory systems
- Test agent coordination workflows

### **Phase 4: Universal Access** (Week 4)
- Finalize universal access framework
- Complete testing across project types
- Documentation and deployment

## Risk Assessment

### **High Risk**
- **Dependency Delays**: Core FE features may not be ready
- **Migration Complexity**: Workflow changes may break existing processes
- **Agent Coordination**: Complex handoff logic between agents

### **Medium Risk**
- **Performance Impact**: Database calls vs file operations
- **Context Loss**: Information may be lost in migration
- **Cross-Project Compatibility**: Different project structures

### **Low Risk**
- **Command Mapping**: Straightforward MCP integration
- **Agent Profile Migration**: Well-defined structure exists

## Post-Sprint Goals

### **Immediate (Sprint 49)**
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Advanced agent coordination features
- Additional context integration capabilities

### **Future Sprints**
- Multi-project sprint coordination
- Advanced RAG features for context retrieval
- Agent learning and improvement systems
- Integration with external project management tools
