# ENG-09-01: Remaining Conflict Resolution - Agent Assignment

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: ENG-09-01  
**Sprint**: 47  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Complexity**: Medium

## Agent Assignment
**Primary Agent**: Senior Engineer + DSL Specialist  
**Skills Required**:
- Command system architecture expertise
- YAML DSL framework proficiency
- Conflict resolution and feature merging
- Laravel application development

## Task Description
Resolve the remaining 3 command conflicts using the proven unification pattern established in Sprint 46 with the `recall` command. Each conflict involves merging hardcoded PHP functionality with existing YAML DSL implementations.

## Target Command Conflicts

### **1. `todo` Command Unification**
**Conflict**: Hardcoded=full CRUD operations, YAML=simple AI-assisted creation
**Resolution Strategy**: Create unified command supporting both simple creation and full management
**Features to Merge**:
- CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- AI-assisted todo generation
- Status management and tracking
- Fragment integration

### **2. `inbox` Command Unification**  
**Conflict**: Hardcoded=multi-view inbox system, YAML=API documentation
**Resolution Strategy**: Merge inbox management with API documentation features
**Features to Merge**:
- Inbox item management and filtering
- Multi-view display options
- API documentation integration
- Notification and status systems

### **3. `search` Command Unification**
**Conflict**: Hardcoded=advanced filtering capabilities, YAML=basic search
**Resolution Strategy**: Enhance YAML version with advanced filtering while maintaining simplicity
**Features to Merge**:
- Basic fragment search
- Advanced filtering and query options
- Search result formatting
- Performance optimization

## Technical Approach

### **Unification Pattern** (Proven in Sprint 46)
1. **Feature Analysis**: Document all capabilities from both implementations
2. **Unified Design**: Create workflow supporting all features with parameter-based mode selection
3. **Implementation**: Use enhanced DSL steps (condition, fragment.query, etc.)
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive validation of all original functionality

### **DSL Steps to Utilize**
- `condition` - Mode selection and branching logic
- `fragment.query` - Advanced database queries
- `fragment.update` - State and metadata management
- `database.update` - Direct CRUD operations
- `validate` - Input validation and error handling
- `response.panel` - UI panel responses

## Deliverables

### **1. Unified Command Implementations**
- `fragments/commands/todo-unified/command.yaml`
- `fragments/commands/inbox-unified/command.yaml`  
- `fragments/commands/search-unified/command.yaml`

### **2. Documentation**
- Migration patterns and decision rationale
- Feature comparison and unification strategy
- Testing results and validation reports

### **3. Registry Updates**
- Update `CommandRegistry.php` to comment out resolved conflicts
- Cache command updates for unified versions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 3 conflicts resolved with unified implementations
- [ ] 100% feature parity maintained from both original versions
- [ ] Zero functionality regression across all use cases
- [ ] Backward compatibility preserved for existing users
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] Comprehensive testing completed

## Dependencies
- Sprint 46 DSL framework enhancements (completed)
- Enhanced template engine capabilities (completed)
- Proven conflict resolution patterns (established)

## Risk Considerations
- **Feature Complexity**: Some advanced features may challenge DSL capabilities
- **Performance Impact**: Unified commands may have more complex execution paths
- **User Experience**: Ensure mode selection doesn't confuse existing workflows

## Risk Mitigation
- **Pattern Adherence**: Strict use of proven Sprint 46 unification pattern
- **Incremental Testing**: Validate each conflict resolution individually
- **Rollback Planning**: Maintain original implementations until validation complete

## Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive feature testing for all original capabilities
- Performance benchmarking against original implementations
- User workflow validation for backward compatibility
- Error handling and edge case testing

This task continues the successful Sprint 46 approach, applying proven patterns to resolve remaining conflicts systematically.
