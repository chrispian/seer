## Dependencies Between Phases
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 sidebar completion
- Phase 3 requires Phase 2 layout foundation
- Phase 4 builds on all previous layout work
- Phase 5 requires stable foundation from all previous phases

## Risk Mitigation
- Incremental deployment to avoid breaking changes
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Fallback mechanisms for layout issues
- Performance monitoring throughout implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
- All existing functionality preserved
- Responsive design across all breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Performance maintained or improved
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Documentation updated for new patterns
- Widget system fully compatible with new layout
- Foundation ready for user customization features

## Testing Strategy
- Visual regression testing for layout changes
- Responsive testing across device sizes
