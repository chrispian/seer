# Customization Foundation Context

## Current Layout System
- Fixed layout with predefined widget positions
- RightRail with hardcoded widget arrangement
- No user customization or personalization features
- Static layout that doesn't adapt to user preferences

## Customization Vision
- User-configurable widget arrangements
- Drag-and-drop widget positioning (future)
- Layout preferences that persist across sessions
- Multiple layout presets and themes
- Widget visibility toggling
- Responsive customization across devices

## Technical Architecture Goals
- Slot-based layout system for flexible widget positioning
- User preference storage and synchronization
- Layout state management with Zustand integration
- Extensible framework for future customization features
- Performance-optimized layout updates

## Layout Slot System Design
```
Layout Slots:
├── Sidebar Slots
│   ├── Top Navigation
│   ├── Main Navigation
│   └── Bottom Actions
├── Main Content Slots
│   ├── Header Slot
│   ├── Primary Content
│   └── Footer Slot
└── RightRail Slots
    ├── Top Widgets (customizable order)
    ├── Middle Widgets (customizable order)
    └── Bottom Widget (SessionInfo - fixed)
```

## User Preference Storage
- **Phase 1**: localStorage for basic preferences
- **Phase 2**: Backend user preferences (future)
- **Phase 3**: Cloud sync across devices (future)

## Customization Capabilities (Planned)
- Widget reordering within RightRail
- Widget visibility toggle (show/hide)
- Layout density options (compact/comfortable/spacious)
- Widget size adjustments where applicable
- Custom widget arrangements per project/vault

## Technical Requirements
- Preserve existing widget functionality during customization
- Maintain responsive behavior across all custom layouts
- Ensure accessibility during drag-and-drop operations
- Optimize performance for layout changes
- Provide fallback to default layout if customization fails

## Integration Points
- Zustand store for layout state management
- React Query for preference persistence
- Existing widget system architecture
- Current responsive design patterns
- AppShell and RightRail components

## Future Enhancement Readiness
- Drag-and-drop library integration (react-beautiful-dnd or similar)
- Advanced layout algorithms
- Layout templates and presets
- Widget marketplace/plugins
- Advanced personalization based on usage patterns

## Success Metrics
- Foundation supports basic widget reordering
- User preferences persist reliably across sessions
- Performance maintained during customization
- Framework ready for drag-and-drop enhancement
- Clean, documented API for customization features
