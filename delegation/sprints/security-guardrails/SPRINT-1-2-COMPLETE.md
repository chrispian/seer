# Sprints 1 & 2: Foundation + Approval Workflow - ✅ COMPLETE

## Status: Complete

## Time: ~4 hours (vs. 2 weeks estimated)

## Summary
Built complete security foundation with database-driven policies, risk scoring, dry-run simulation, AND full approval workflow with inline/modal UX.

---

## Sprint 1: Foundation & Policy Layer ✅

### GUARD-001: PolicyRegistry ✅
- Database schema: `security_policies` + `security_policy_versions`
- 33 default policies seeded (tools, commands, paths, domains)
- Wildcard pattern matching (`*.github.com`, `fs.*`)
- Priority-based evaluation (deny > allow)
- Cached queries (1-hour TTL)
- Hot-reload support

### GUARD-002: RiskScorer ✅
- Multi-dimensional scoring (0-100 scale)
- 4 risk levels: low/medium/high/critical
- 4 threshold actions: auto_approve → require_approval_with_justification
- Methods: `scoreToolCall()`, `scoreCommand()`, `scoreFileOperation()`, `scoreNetworkOperation()`
- Intelligent pattern detection (dangerous commands, sensitive files, private IPs)

### GUARD-003: DryRunSimulator ✅
- Simulate operations without execution
- Policy + risk evaluation
- Change prediction
- Warning generation
- Parameter sanitization

---

## Sprint 2: Approval Workflow ✅

### GUARD-004: Approval Hook System ✅
**Model:** `ApprovalRequest`
```sql
- operation_type, operation_summary, operation_details
- risk_score, risk_level, risk_factors
- dry_run_result (JSON)
- fragment_id (for long content)
- status (pending/approved/rejected/timeout)
- conversation_id, message_id
- timeout_at (5-minute default)
```

**Service:** `ApprovalManager`
- `createApprovalRequest()` - Creates approval with risk assessment
- `approveRequest()` - Approves and logs to audit trail
- `rejectRequest()` - Rejects and logs to audit trail
- `detectApprovalInMessage()` - Natural language detection
- `formatForChat()` - Format for frontend display
- Auto-determines inline vs modal based on content size

### GUARD-005: Approval UI Components ✅
**ApprovalButton Component** (`resources/js/components/ApprovalButton.tsx`)
- Inline risk display with score + factors
- Approve/Reject buttons
- Shows approval/rejection status after decision
- Color-coded risk levels (green/yellow/orange/red)
- Disappears after user decision, shows timestamp

**FragmentPreviewModal Component** (`resources/js/components/FragmentPreviewModal.tsx`)
- Full markdown rendering
- Word count + read time display
- Risk badge display
- Approve/Reject footer
- Scrollable for long content
- Clean dark mode support

**ChatTranscript Integration** ✅
- Extended `ChatMessage` interface with `approvalRequest` field
- Renders `ApprovalButton` inline for short operations
- Opens `FragmentPreviewModal` for long content
- Passes approval callbacks to buttons

### GUARD-006: Approval Audit Trail ✅
- Integrated with Spatie Activity Log (from TASK-0002)
- Logs approval/rejection with user attribution
- Tracks approval method (button_click vs natural_language)
- Includes risk score and operation details
- Full audit trail for compliance

## Configuration

### File: `config/security/approval.php`
```php
'timeout_minutes' => 5,

'inline_approval' => [
    'max_characters' => 500,
    'max_words' => 100,
    'max_lines' => 15,
],

'natural_language_approval' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'approval_keywords' => ['yes', 'approve', 'go ahead', ...],
    'rejection_keywords' => ['no', 'reject', 'cancel', ...],
],
```

### API Endpoints Created
```
POST /api/approvals/{id}/approve
POST /api/approvals/{id}/reject
GET  /api/approvals/{id}
GET  /api/approvals/pending
```

---

## Test Results

### Backend Tests ✅
```
Command Approval Flow:
  rm -rf /tmp/test
  ✓ Approval created (ID: 1)
  ✓ Risk: 60 (high)
  ✓ Status: pending → approved
  ✓ Logged to activity_log

Auto-Approval:
  ls -la
  ✓ Auto-approved (risk: 20, low)
  ✓ No approval request created

Natural Language Detection:
  "yes, go ahead" → approve ✓
  "no, cancel that" → reject ✓
  "let me think" → null (ambiguous) ✓
```

### Frontend Build ✅
```
✓ ApprovalButton component created
✓ FragmentPreviewModal component created
✓ ChatTranscript integrated
✓ npm run build successful (4.55s)
✓ No TypeScript errors
```

---

## User Experience Flows Implemented

### Flow 1: Inline Approval (Short Commands) ✅
```
User: "Delete old log files"
