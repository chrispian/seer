## 🚧 In Progress

### Type System Backend (Phase 2.1)
Creating API endpoints for type pack management:
- POST `/api/types` - Create type pack

- POST `/api/types/{slug}/validate` - Validate pack
- POST `/api/types/{slug}/refresh-cache` - Cache management

**Files to Create:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/TypePackController.php`
- `app/Services/TypeSystem/TypePackManager.php`
- `app/Http/Requests/StoreTypePackRequest.php`
- `app/Http/Requests/UpdateTypePackRequest.php`

- AppSidebar full refactor can wait for dedicated frontend sprint
