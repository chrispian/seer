## Task Details

### Task: Phase 1 - Core Generator Framework

**Purpose**: Build the foundational command generator infrastructure

**Objectives**:
1. Create config schema and validation
2. Implement main artisan command with dry-run mode
3. Create base generator classes and stub system
4. Add unit tests

**Deliverables**:
- `config/command-generator.php` with full schema
- `app/Console/Commands/MakeCommandModule.php`
- `BaseGenerator` and `GeneratorConfig` classes
- Stub directory structure
- Unit tests

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Can run generator in dry-run mode
- ✅ Config validation catches invalid schemas
- ✅ BaseGenerator renders stubs with variables
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ PSR-12 compliant code

## Agent Configuration Highlights

### Capabilities
```yaml
allowed_actions:
  - scaffold.command
  - scaffold.config
  - scaffold.generator
  - test.write

allowed_tools:
  - fs, git, composer, php-artisan
```

### Safety Rails
```yaml
fs_scope:
  - app/Console/Commands/
  - config/
  - resources/stubs/
  - tests/Unit/

tool_whitelist:
  - composer
  - php artisan test
```

### Context
```yaml
reference_docs:
  - delegation/tasks/COMMAND-GENERATOR-SYSTEM.md
  - docs/NAVIGATION_SYSTEM_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md
  - app/Commands/Orchestration/Sprint/ListCommand.php
```

### Tracing
```yaml
agent_steps:
  last: null  # First task in sprint
  next: phase-2-handlers  # Next task
```

---

## How to Delegate

### Option 1: Direct Delegation
```
"Agent, please execute task phase-1-core in 
delegation/sprints/command-generator/phase-1-core/"
```

### Option 2: With Context
```
"Agent, I need you to implement Phase 1 of the Command Generator System. 
The complete task specification is in 
delegation/sprints/command-generator/phase-1-core/

Read AGENT.yml for your capabilities and constraints, 
then read TASK.md for detailed instructions.

Focus on infrastructure only - don't implement actual code generation yet."
```

### What the Agent Will Do
1. Read AGENT.yml → understand capabilities, safety rails, context
2. Read TASK.md → understand objectives, deliverables, acceptance criteria
3. Read reference docs (COMMAND-GENERATOR-SYSTEM.md, etc.)
4. Implement the work (create files, write code, add tests)
5. Update TASK.md status section with progress
6. On completion, update AGENT.yml agent_steps

## Testing the System

This validates our new template system:

### ✅ Template System Works
- Scripts created sprint and task successfully
- Hash generation automatic
- Tracing configured (last/next)
- Files created in correct locations

### ✅ Customization Works
- TASK.md filled with real requirements
- AGENT.yml configured with specific capabilities
- Safety rails appropriate for task
- Context docs linked correctly

### ✅ Ready for Agent
- Agent has ONE file to start (AGENT.yml)
- Clear capabilities and constraints
- Clear objectives and acceptance criteria
- Reference docs linked

## File Contents Summary

### AGENT.yml
- **Task ID**: phase-1-core
- **Task Hash**: 7fa80122288479292506c67f005393d5dabb27ca0b3808a12abac554a3ca5646
- **Priority**: P0
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Tracing**: null → phase-1-core → phase-2-handlers
- **Capabilities**: scaffold.command, scaffold.config, scaffold.generator, test.write
- **FS Scope**: app/Console/Commands/, config/, resources/stubs/, tests/Unit/
- **Reference Docs**: 3 linked (spec, architecture, example)

### TASK.md
- **5 Task Categories**: Config schema, main command, base classes, stubs, tests
- **5 Deliverables**: All clearly defined with file paths
- **7 Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable
- **Testing**: Manual + automated test commands
- **References**: 5 linked docs with examples
- **Notes**: Design decisions and constraints

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Review**: Check task makes sense
2. **Delegate**: Give to agent
3. **Monitor**: Track progress in TASK.md status section

### After Phase 1 Completes
1. Create phase-2-handlers task (handler generator)
2. Create phase-3-modals task (modal generator)
3. Continue building out the sprint

### Sprint Completion
When all phases done:
- Working generator that creates commands in <10 minutes
- Reduces manual work from 2-3 hours to 10 minutes
- Standardizes command creation across team

---

## Template System Validation

### What We Proved
✅ **Fast**: Sprint + task created in < 2 minutes  
✅ **Complete**: All necessary sections populated  
✅ **Traceable**: Hash and last/next pointers set  
✅ **Safe**: Appropriate safety rails configured  
✅ **Clear**: Agent knows exactly what to do  
✅ **Customizable**: Easy to fill in real requirements  

### What Worked Well
- Scripts automated repetitive work
- Templates provided good structure
- Placeholders clear and easy to replace
- Hash generation automatic
- Tracing infrastructure solid

### What Could Improve
- SPRINT.md still needs manual customization
- README.md task index needs manual update
- Could add more task templates for common patterns

## Conclusion

**Template System Status**: ✅ **Production Ready**

Successfully used the new template system to create a real task for the Command Generator System. The task is:
- Fully configured
- Ready for agent delegation
- Properly traced
- Well-documented

**Task Ready**: ✅ **Ready for Delegation**

Agent can start work immediately by reading:
1. `delegation/sprints/command-generator/phase-1-core/AGENT.yml`
2. `delegation/sprints/command-generator/phase-1-core/TASK.md`
