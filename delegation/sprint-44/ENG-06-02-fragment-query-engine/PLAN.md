# ENG-06-02 Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Query Parser Foundation (3-4 hours)
1. Create QueryParser service with syntax parsing
2. Implement tokenization for query components
3. Add validation for query syntax and security
4. Create query AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) structure

## Phase 2: Query Execution Engine (3-4 hours)
5. Implement QueryExecutor service with Fragment integration
6. Add type filtering with multiple type support
7. Create tag filtering with inclusion/exclusion logic
8. Implement where clause execution with field operators

## Phase 3: Sorting and Pagination (2-3 hours)
9. Add sorting support for all Fragment fields
10. Implement pagination with limit/offset
11. Create result counting and metadata
12. Add proper query result formatting

## Phase 4: Context and Optimization (2-3 hours)
13. Implement context resolution (@ws:, @proj:)
14. Add query optimization and caching
15. Create performance monitoring and indexing
16. Add comprehensive error handling and validation

## Dependencies
- Requires ENG-06-01 completion (TransclusionSpec foundation)
- Depends on existing Fragment model and relationships
- Needs context resolution system

## Success Criteria
- Query parser handles all syntax variations correctly
- Query execution works with Fragment model efficiently
- Filtering, sorting, and pagination work properly
- Context resolution applies workspace/project scoping
- Performance is optimized with proper caching

## Total Estimated Time: 10-14 hours
