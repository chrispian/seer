# Implementation Summary

## Outcomes
- Added `App\Services\DelegationMigrationService` to parse `delegation/SPRINT_STATUS.md`, promote agent templates, and map sprint task folders into `sprints`, `work_items`, and `sprint_items` tables.
- Delivered `delegation:import` Artisan command with dry-run preview, sprint filters, and concise summary output for CLI usage.
- Normalised status + estimate data into orchestration fields (delegation status mapping, averaged hour estimates, TODO completion stats) while preserving source metadata in JSON columns.
- Seeded agent templates into `agent_profiles` via the existing service layer so CLI/MCP tooling can reference canonical agent records.

## Testing
- `./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/DelegationMigrationServiceTest.php`
- `./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/AgentProfileServiceTest.php`

## Follow-ups
- Wire freshly imported data into upcoming CLI/MCP commands (ORCH-01-04) and dashboard UI.
- Consider extending importer to capture detailed TODO completion percentages per section and attach business goal bullet lists to sprint analytics.
- Evaluate adding assignment records once active agent ownership is established in future sprints.
