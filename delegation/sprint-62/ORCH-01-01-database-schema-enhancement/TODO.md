# Database Schema Enhancement TODO

## Pre-Implementation Setup
- [ ] Review existing database migrations and models
- [ ] Analyze delegation folder structure for data patterns
- [ ] Set up development database for testing
- [ ] Create backup of existing data

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Migration: Create agent_profiles Table (45 min)
- [ ] Create migration: `create_agent_profiles_table`
- [ ] Define table schema with all required fields
- [ ] Add proper constraints and indexes
- [ ] Include rollback method
- [ ] Test migration on development database

### 2. Migration: Enhance work_items Table (30 min)
- [ ] Create migration: `enhance_work_items_for_orchestration`
- [ ] Add delegation_status field with default
- [ ] Add delegation_context JSON field
- [ ] Add delegation_history JSON field
- [ ] Add estimated_hours and actual_hours fields
- [ ] Test backward compatibility

### 3. Migration: Create task_assignments Table (45 min)
- [ ] Create migration: `create_task_assignments_table`
- [ ] Define assignment tracking schema
- [ ] Add foreign key relationships
- [ ] Add status and timing fields
- [ ] Include proper indexes

### 4. Add Database Indexes (30 min)
- [ ] Create migration: `add_orchestration_indexes`
- [ ] Add composite indexes for common queries
- [ ] Add foreign key indexes for performance
- [ ] Test query performance improvements

### 5. Update Eloquent Models (30 min)
- [ ] Update WorkItem model with new fields
- [ ] Add AgentProfile model relationships
- [ ] Add TaskAssignment model relationships
- [ ] Update model factories for testing

## Testing and Validation

### Migration Testing
- [ ] Test fresh migration on clean database
- [ ] Test rollback functionality for all migrations
- [ ] Verify foreign key constraints work
- [ ] Test with both PostgreSQL and SQLite

### Model Testing
- [ ] Test all Eloquent relationships
- [ ] Verify eager loading works correctly
- [ ] Test model factories create valid data
- [ ] Performance test common queries

### Data Integrity
- [ ] Verify constraint enforcement
- [ ] Test cascade delete behavior
- [ ] Validate JSON field structures
- [ ] Check index effectiveness

## Performance Validation
- [ ] Analyze query execution plans
- [ ] Benchmark common query patterns
- [ ] Verify index usage in EXPLAIN plans
- [ ] Test with sample dataset

## Documentation
- [ ] Document new table schemas
- [ ] Update model documentation
- [ ] Create migration notes
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] Code review database schema design
- [ ] Validate naming conventions
- [ ] Check for potential N+1 query issues
- [ ] Verify Laravel best practices compliance

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] All migrations created and tested
- [ ] Models updated with proper relationships
- [ ] Indexes added for query optimization
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Documentation completed
- [ ] Code review passed

## Rollback Plan
- [ ] Document rollback procedure for each migration
- [ ] Test rollback on development environment
- [ ] Identify potential data loss scenarios
- [ ] Create rollback checklist for production

## Next Steps (for Sprint 62 continuation)
- [ ] Prepare for delegation folder parsing
- [ ] Design data import strategy
- [ ] Plan CLI command interfaces
- [ ] Consider API endpoint requirements
