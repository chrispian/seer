# Sprint 59: Settings Experience Enhancement

## Overview
**Duration**: 5-7 days (40-56 hours)  
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Type**: UX Enhancement  

## Problem Statement
The current `/settings` experience has several gaps that limit user configuration capabilities and admin control. Based on the settings experience audit, critical features like import/reset functionality are incomplete, AI provider configuration is static rather than dynamic, notification preferences lack granularity, and admin controls for environment-driven flags are missing.

## Goals
- Complete the settings management card with import/reset pipelines
- Implement dynamic AI provider/model configuration from catalog
- Expand notification preferences with granular channel controls
- Add admin-only panels for environment-driven configuration
- Improve UX with per-section loading states

## Sprint Scope

### High Priority (Core Features)
- **SETTINGS-001**: Import/Reset Settings Pipeline (10-14h)
- **SETTINGS-002**: Dynamic AI Provider Configuration (12-16h)

### Medium Priority (Enhanced UX)
- **SETTINGS-003**: Granular Notification Preferences (8-12h)
- **SETTINGS-004**: Admin Configuration Panels (6-10h)
- **SETTINGS-005**: Per-Section Loading States (4-6h)

## Task Packs

### SETTINGS-001: Import/Reset Settings Pipeline
**Effort**: 10-14 hours  
**Goal**: Complete settings management with import/reset functionality  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Backend endpoints for settings import/export/reset
- Client-side dialogs with confirmation UX
- File validation and error handling
- Secure reset flows with confirmation

### SETTINGS-002: Dynamic AI Provider Configuration
**Effort**: 12-16 hours  
**Goal**: Replace static AI options with dynamic provider catalog  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Load provider/model metadata from `config/fragments.php`
- Capability/status badges and missing-key warnings
- API key validation and prerequisites
- Project-level limit guardrails

### SETTINGS-003: Granular Notification Preferences
**Effort**: 8-12 hours  
**Goal**: Expand notification controls with channel-specific options  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Granular notification channels (digest emails, real-time alerts)
- Contextual copy and preference groupings
- Enhanced preference persistence
- Channel-specific validation

### SETTINGS-004: Admin Configuration Panels
**Effort**: 6-10 hours  
**Goal**: Add admin controls for environment-driven configuration  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Admin-only panels for env flags
- Read-only state when settings locked
- Environment detection and status display
- Role-based access controls

### SETTINGS-005: Per-Section Loading States
**Effort**: 4-6 hours  
**Goal**: Improve feedback clarity with section-specific loading  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Separate loading states per tab section
- Prevent global spinners during local actions
- Enhanced success/error feedback
- Optimistic UI updates

## Dependencies
- **Related Work**: Coordinates with Sprint 42 (settings scaffolding), Sprint 45 (provider dashboards), Sprint 57 (vector configuration)
- **Prerequisites**: None - can start immediately
- **Execution Order**: SETTINGS-001/002 (parallel foundation) → SETTINGS-003/004 (enhanced features) → SETTINGS-005 (polish)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete settings import/export/reset flows functional
- [ ] AI provider configuration driven by dynamic catalog
- [ ] Granular notification preferences implemented
- [ ] Admin configuration panels accessible and secured
- [ ] Per-section loading states improve user feedback
- [ ] All settings persist correctly and validate appropriately
- [ ] Integration tests cover critical settings flows
- [ ] Settings experience feels cohesive and professional

## Estimated Effort
**Total**: 40-56 hours across 5 task packs  
**Critical Path**: SETTINGS-001 + SETTINGS-002 (22-30h core foundation)  
**Parallel Work**: SETTINGS-003/004 can run concurrently after foundation  
**Polish**: SETTINGS-005 requires core sections complete
