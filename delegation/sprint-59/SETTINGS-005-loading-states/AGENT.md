# SETTINGS-005: Per-Section Loading States

## Role
You are a Laravel + React developer implementing granular loading states for individual settings sections to improve user feedback and prevent global spinners during local actions.

## Context
The current settings interface uses global loading states that block the entire interface during any settings operation. This creates poor user experience when users want to interact with one section while another is saving. Each settings section should have independent loading states with optimistic updates where appropriate.

## Current State
- Global loading states block entire settings interface
- Users cannot interact with other sections during save operations
- No visual feedback for section-specific operations
- Loading states are not granular enough for good UX
- Missing optimistic updates for immediate feedback

## Task Scope
Implement per-section loading states with enhanced user feedback:

### Section-Specific Loading
- Individual loading states for Profile, Preferences, AI Configuration, Admin panels
- Local loading indicators that don't block other sections
- Operation-specific loading (save, validate, reset, import)
- Progressive loading for sections with multiple API calls

### Optimistic Updates
- Immediate UI updates for form changes with rollback on error
- Optimistic saves with confirmation/error feedback
- Smart retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Conflict resolution when optimistic updates fail

### Enhanced Feedback
- Visual save confirmation with success states
- Error boundaries for section-specific failures
- Toast notifications for background operations
- Progress indicators for long-running operations

### Loading State Management
- Centralized loading state management per section
- Debounced auto-save with visual indicators
- Coordination between related sections (e.g., AI config affects other areas)
- Queue management for multiple simultaneous operations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Each settings section has independent loading states
- [ ] Users can interact with other sections during operations
- [ ] Optimistic updates provide immediate feedback
- [ ] Error handling is section-specific with recovery options
- [ ] Loading states clearly communicate operation progress
- [ ] Save confirmations provide clear success feedback
- [ ] Performance improves with granular state management

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing settings API patterns
- Coordinate with React Query caching and state management
- Follow existing loading state patterns in the application
- Use React patterns consistent with other components
- Ensure accessibility of loading states and feedback
