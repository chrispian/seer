# Delegation Notes
- This pack assumes your repo already has a top-level `delegation/` folder and standard workflow.
- Copy the `sprint-template/` folder into your repo's `delegation/` for each new sprint (e.g., `delegation/Sprint-006/`).
- The Project Manager agent will then generate **task packs** under `delegation/Sprint-XXX/tasks/`.
