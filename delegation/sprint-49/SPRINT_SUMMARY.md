# Sprint 49: System Polish & Agent Tooling Foundation

## Sprint Overview
**Duration**: 1.5-2 days  
**Focus**: Polish Sprint 48 work and establish agent tooling foundation  
**Priority**: High - Build on Sprint 48 success and enable advanced capabilities

## Sprint Objectives

### **Primary Goal**: Fix Condition YAML Parsing Issue
Address the identified P2 issue where condition steps receive empty strings instead of template expressions, preventing commands like `/bookmark list` from working with conditional logic.

### **Secondary Goal**: Agent Tooling Foundation System
Establish the foundation for advanced agent capabilities by building a comprehensive tooling system that leverages the database framework built in Sprint 48.

## Sprint Tasks

### **ENG-10-01: Condition YAML Parsing Fix** (2-4 hours) ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)  
**Objective**: Fix template parsing in condition steps to enable complex command argument parsing

**Problem**: Commands like `/bookmark list` fail because condition templates like `{{ ctx.body == 'list' }}` become empty strings instead of being properly evaluated.

**Root Cause Identified & Fixed**:
- CommandRunner was pre-rendering condition templates before passing to ConditionStep
- Context was double-nested (ctx.ctx.body instead of ctx.body) in buildExecutionContext
- Fixed by skipping template rendering for condition fields and correcting context structure

**Technical Requirements**:
- [x] Fix YAML parsing to preserve condition templates ✅
- [x] Ensure proper template evaluation timing in ConditionStep ✅
- [x] Maintain backwards compatibility with existing commands ✅
- [x] Add comprehensive tests for condition template scenarios ✅

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] `/bookmark list` works correctly with proper conditional logic ✅
- [x] All existing condition-based commands function properly ✅
- [x] Template expressions in conditions evaluate correctly ✅
- [x] No regression in working commands ✅

### **ENG-10-02: Agent Tooling Foundation** (8-12 hours) ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: High  
**Objective**: Build comprehensive agent tooling system leveraging Sprint 48 database framework

**System Components**:
- [x] **Tool Registry System**: Centralized tool management and discovery ✅
- [x] **Agent Memory Foundation**: Persistent agent state and context management ✅
- [x] **Tool SDK Framework**: Developer toolkit for creating custom agent tools ✅
- [x] **Database Integration**: Leverage new model.* steps for tool data management ✅
- [x] **Security Framework**: Tool permission and access control system ✅

**Technical Architecture Implemented**:
- ✅ Contract-based tool architecture with JSON schema validation
- ✅ Tool registry with automatic discovery and registration (ToolServiceProvider)
- ✅ Agent memory system with TTL, tagging, and provenance tracking
- ✅ Database query tool supporting all major entities
- ✅ Internal API endpoints (/api/internal/db/query, /memory/write, /memory/search)
- ✅ Comprehensive data models (AgentNote, WorkItem, Sprint, Artifact, etc.)

**Database Schema Created**:
- ✅ agent_notes: Memory storage with UUID keys, JSON metadata
- ✅ saved_queries: Query persistence for reuse  
- ✅ work_items/sprints: Project management foundation
- ✅ artifacts: File/export artifact management
- ✅ agent_decisions/vectors: Advanced AI integration points

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Tool registry operational with CRUD operations ✅
- [x] Agent memory system stores and retrieves context ✅  
- [x] SDK enables rapid tool development ✅
- [x] Database operations secure and performant ✅
- [x] Foundation ready for advanced agent capabilities ✅

## Technical Foundation

### **Available from Sprint 48**
- ✅ **Database Step Framework**: `model.query`, `model.create`, `model.update`, `model.delete`
- ✅ **Enhanced Condition Engine**: Template rendering with logical operators
- ✅ **Security Hardening**: Field validation and operator whitelisting
- ✅ **JSON Support**: Proper arrow notation and semantic handling

### **Sprint 49 Build Strategy**
- **Phase 1**: Quick fix for condition parsing (maintains Sprint 48 momentum)
- **Phase 2**: Strategic investment in agent tooling (enables future capabilities)

## Expected Outcomes

### **Technical Deliverables**
- **Condition parsing fully functional** across all command scenarios
- **Agent tooling foundation** ready for advanced capabilities
- **Tool SDK documentation** and development guidelines
- **Database-backed tool registry** operational

### **System Impact**
- **100% command functionality** with proper conditional logic
- **Advanced agent capabilities enabled** through tooling foundation
- **Developer productivity improved** through tool SDK
- **Strategic foundation** for future AI/agent enhancements

### **Strategic Progress**
- **Sprint 48 polish completed** with all known issues resolved
- **Next-generation capabilities unlocked** through agent tooling
- **Development velocity increased** through improved tooling
- **Foundation ready** for advanced AI integrations

## Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
- **Parsing Complexity**: Leverage existing template engine patterns
- **Tool Security**: Build on Sprint 48 security hardening
- **Performance Impact**: Use proven database step patterns

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Incremental Development**: Fix parsing first, then build tooling
- **Pattern Reuse**: Leverage successful Sprint 48 patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Validate each component independently

## Success Metrics

### **Quantitative Targets**
- [ ] 100% condition-based commands functional
- [ ] Tool registry supports CRUD operations
