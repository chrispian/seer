# Sprint 49: System Polish & Agent Tooling Foundation

## Sprint Overview
**Duration**: 1.5-2 days  
**Focus**: Polish Sprint 48 work and establish agent tooling foundation  
**Priority**: High - Build on Sprint 48 success and enable advanced capabilities

## Sprint Objectives

### **Primary Goal**: Fix Condition YAML Parsing Issue
Address the identified P2 issue where condition steps receive empty strings instead of template expressions, preventing commands like `/bookmark list` from working with conditional logic.

### **Secondary Goal**: Agent Tooling Foundation System
Establish the foundation for advanced agent capabilities by building a comprehensive tooling system that leverages the database framework built in Sprint 48.

## Sprint Tasks

### **ENG-10-01: Condition YAML Parsing Fix** (2-4 hours)
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)  
**Objective**: Fix template parsing in condition steps to enable complex command argument parsing

**Problem**: Commands like `/bookmark list` fail because condition templates like `{{ ctx.body == 'list' }}` become empty strings instead of being properly evaluated.

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Fix YAML parsing to preserve condition templates
- [ ] Ensure proper template evaluation timing in ConditionStep
- [ ] Maintain backwards compatibility with existing commands
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for condition template scenarios

**Success Criteria**:
- `/bookmark list` works correctly with proper conditional logic
- All existing condition-based commands function properly
- Template expressions in conditions evaluate correctly
- No regression in working commands

### **ENG-10-02: Agent Tooling Foundation** (8-12 hours)
**Priority**: High  
**Objective**: Build comprehensive agent tooling system leveraging Sprint 48 database framework

**System Components**:
- [ ] **Tool Registry System**: Centralized tool management and discovery
- [ ] **Agent Memory Foundation**: Persistent agent state and context management
- [ ] **Tool SDK Framework**: Developer toolkit for creating custom agent tools
- [ ] **Database Integration**: Leverage new model.* steps for tool data management
- [ ] **Security Framework**: Tool permission and access control system

**Technical Architecture**:
- Agent tool registry with database persistence
- Tool execution environment with sandboxing
- Memory management with context preservation
- API layer for tool registration and discovery

**Success Criteria**:
- Tool registry operational with CRUD operations
- Agent memory system stores and retrieves context
- SDK enables rapid tool development
- Database operations secure and performant
- Foundation ready for advanced agent capabilities

## Technical Foundation

### **Available from Sprint 48**
- ✅ **Database Step Framework**: `model.query`, `model.create`, `model.update`, `model.delete`
- ✅ **Enhanced Condition Engine**: Template rendering with logical operators
- ✅ **Security Hardening**: Field validation and operator whitelisting
- ✅ **JSON Support**: Proper arrow notation and semantic handling

### **Sprint 49 Build Strategy**
- **Phase 1**: Quick fix for condition parsing (maintains Sprint 48 momentum)
- **Phase 2**: Strategic investment in agent tooling (enables future capabilities)

## Expected Outcomes

### **Technical Deliverables**
- **Condition parsing fully functional** across all command scenarios
- **Agent tooling foundation** ready for advanced capabilities
- **Tool SDK documentation** and development guidelines
- **Database-backed tool registry** operational

### **System Impact**
- **100% command functionality** with proper conditional logic
- **Advanced agent capabilities enabled** through tooling foundation
- **Developer productivity improved** through tool SDK
- **Strategic foundation** for future AI/agent enhancements

### **Strategic Progress**
- **Sprint 48 polish completed** with all known issues resolved
- **Next-generation capabilities unlocked** through agent tooling
- **Development velocity increased** through improved tooling
- **Foundation ready** for advanced AI integrations

## Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
- **Parsing Complexity**: Leverage existing template engine patterns
- **Tool Security**: Build on Sprint 48 security hardening
- **Performance Impact**: Use proven database step patterns

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Incremental Development**: Fix parsing first, then build tooling
- **Pattern Reuse**: Leverage successful Sprint 48 patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Validate each component independently

## Success Metrics

### **Quantitative Targets**
- [ ] 100% condition-based commands functional
- [ ] Tool registry supports CRUD operations
- [ ] Agent memory system operational
- [ ] SDK enables tool development in <2 hours
- [ ] Zero performance regression from tooling overhead

### **Qualitative Targets**
- [ ] Developer experience significantly improved
- [ ] Foundation ready for advanced agent features
- [ ] System architecture clean and extensible
- [ ] Documentation comprehensive and actionable

Sprint 49 represents both polish and strategic investment - completing Sprint 48 work while establishing the foundation for next-generation agent capabilities.
