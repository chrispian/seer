# DSL-UX-006: Alias Conflict Resolution

## Agent Role
System integrity specialist focused on preventing and resolving command alias conflicts. Ensure a robust conflict detection and resolution system that maintains command system reliability.

## Objective
Implement comprehensive alias conflict detection during command pack loading, establish precedence rules for conflict resolution, and provide clear feedback to prevent silent command overrides.

## Core Task
Create a conflict detection system that identifies alias collisions between command packs, implements resolution strategies, and provides clear feedback to pack authors and system administrators.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Conflict Detection System
**File**: `app/Services/Commands/ConflictDetector.php`
- Real-time conflict detection during pack loading
- Analysis of slug and alias overlaps
- Reserved command protection
- Cross-pack dependency analysis

### 2. Resolution Strategy Framework
**File**: `app/Services/Commands/ConflictResolver.php`
- Precedence rules (reserved > user packs > order)
- Automatic resolution where possible
- Manual resolution prompts for critical conflicts
- Rollback capabilities for failed resolutions

### 3. Enhanced Pack Loading
**File**: `app/Services/Commands/CommandPackLoader.php` (enhanced)
- Conflict detection integration in `updateRegistryCache()`
- Graceful handling of conflicts during loading
- Clear error messages and resolution suggestions
- Prevention of silent overrides

### 4. Administrative Tools
**File**: `app/Console/Commands/ResolveCommandConflicts.php`
- Artisan command for conflict analysis and resolution
- Interactive conflict resolution interface
- Bulk conflict resolution capabilities
- Conflict reporting and logging

## Success Criteria

### Conflict Prevention:
- [ ] No silent command overrides occur
- [ ] Reserved commands are protected from user pack conflicts
- [ ] Clear warnings provided for detected conflicts
- [ ] Automatic resolution works for non-critical conflicts

### System Integrity:
- [ ] Command resolution remains deterministic
- [ ] Pack loading failures don't corrupt registry
- [ ] Rollback capabilities restore previous state
- [ ] Administrative tools provide clear conflict visibility

### User Experience:
- [ ] Pack authors receive clear conflict feedback
- [ ] System administrators can resolve conflicts easily
- [ ] End users experience consistent command behavior
- [ ] Documentation provides conflict resolution guidance
