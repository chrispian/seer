# DSL-UX-005: Observability & Testing

## Agent Role
Quality assurance and monitoring specialist focused on comprehensive testing coverage and observability for the enhanced DSL command system. Ensure reliability through metrics, logging, and thorough test coverage.

## Objective
Implement comprehensive testing for all DSL UX enhancements, add observability hooks for monitoring system health, and establish metrics for tracking command system performance.

## Core Task
Create a robust testing framework covering unit, integration, and E2E scenarios, implement logging and metrics for operational visibility, and establish monitoring for command system health.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Comprehensive Test Suite
**Files**: `tests/Unit/Commands/*`, `tests/Feature/Commands/*`
- Unit tests for registry metadata extraction and validation
- Integration tests for autocomplete and help system
- Feature tests for command execution and alias resolution
- Performance tests for large command registries

### 2. Observability Framework
**File**: `app/Services/Commands/CommandMetrics.php`
- Metrics for cache rebuild frequency and performance
- Autocomplete response time tracking
- Command execution success/failure rates
- Registry size and growth monitoring

### 3. Logging Enhancements
**Files**: Various controllers and services
- Structured logging for cache rebuild events
- Command resolution and execution logging
- Alias conflict detection and resolution logging
- Performance bottleneck identification

### 4. End-to-End Testing
**File**: `tests/Browser/SlashCommandTest.php`
- Browser tests for keyboard navigation
- Command suggestion and selection flows
- Help system interaction testing
- Error scenario handling

## Success Criteria

### Test Coverage:
- [ ] >90% code coverage for command system components
- [ ] All critical paths covered by integration tests
- [ ] Browser tests cover complete user interaction flows
- [ ] Performance tests establish baseline metrics

### Observability:
- [ ] Key metrics tracked and alerting configured
