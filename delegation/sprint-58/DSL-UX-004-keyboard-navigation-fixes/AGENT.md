# DSL-UX-004: Keyboard Navigation Fixes

## Agent Role
Frontend interaction specialist focused on fixing keyboard navigation issues in the TipTap slash command interface. Ensure reliable arrow key navigation and proper event handling in command suggestion lists.

## Objective
Fix the keyboard navigation issues in `SlashCommandList` where arrow keys close the suggestion popover instead of navigating between options, and enhance the overall interaction experience.

## Core Task
Resolve keyboard event handling in the TipTap suggestion system, implement client-side caching for improved performance, and create comprehensive interaction testing.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Fixed Keyboard Event Handling
**File**: `resources/js/islands/chat/tiptap/extensions/SlashCommand.tsx`
- Proper `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` usage
- Reliable arrow key navigation between suggestions
- Enter key selection without popover dismissal
- Escape key handling for intentional dismissal

### 2. Enhanced Autocomplete Utility
**File**: `resources/js/islands/chat/tiptap/utils/autocomplete.ts`
- Client-side caching to reduce API calls
- Debouncing for rapid typing scenarios
- Request deduplication and cancellation
- Error handling and retry logic

### 3. Improved Suggestion Display
**File**: `resources/js/islands/chat/tiptap/extensions/SlashCommand.tsx`
- Rich metadata display (categories, summaries)
- Alias badges for alternative command triggers
- Loading states during API requests
- Error states for failed requests

### 4. Interaction Testing
**File**: `resources/js/components/chat/SlashCommand.stories.tsx`
- Storybook coverage for keyboard interactions
- Visual regression testing for suggestion display
- Interaction testing for various scenarios
- Performance testing for large command lists
