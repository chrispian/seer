# UX-03-01 Database Schema Agent Profile

## Mission
Enhance the users table schema to support comprehensive user profiles, avatar management, and settings persistence for the setup system.

## Workflow
- Create database migration for user profile fields
- Update User model with profile-related methods and relationships
- Implement proper validation and data integrity constraints
- Test migration rollback functionality
- Use Laravel artisan commands and Eloquent best practices

## Quality Standards
- Migration supports both forward and rollback operations safely
- User model includes proper attribute casting and validation
- Profile settings JSON structure is well-defined and extensible
- Database constraints ensure data integrity
- Migration is production-ready with proper error handling

## Deliverables
- Migration file: `add_profile_fields_to_users_table.php`
- Updated User model with profile methods
- Profile settings schema documentation
- Database validation rules
- Migration testing confirmation

## Key Fields to Add
- `display_name` (string, nullable) - User's preferred display name
- `avatar_path` (string, nullable) - Path to custom avatar file
- `use_gravatar` (boolean, default true) - Whether to use Gravatar
- `profile_settings` (json, nullable) - User preferences and settings
- `profile_completed_at` (timestamp, nullable) - Setup completion timestamp

## Safety Notes
- Ensure migration can be safely rolled back
- Preserve existing user data during migration
- Add proper indexes for performance
- Validate JSON schema for profile_settings
- Test with existing user records

## Communication
- Report migration creation and testing results
- Document any constraints or considerations for rollback
- Provide schema documentation for profile_settings JSON structure
- Confirm database performance impact assessment
