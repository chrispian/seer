# Sprint 52: DSL Flow Builder MVP

## Overview
Create a visual command builder interface that enables users to create, edit, and deploy custom DSL commands through a drag-and-drop interface with real-time validation and preview.

## Sprint Goals
1. **Visual Command Builder**: Drag-drop interface for step composition
2. **Schema Generation**: Machine-readable step schemas for UI forms
3. **Storage Integration**: Database-backed user command storage
4. **Advanced Flow Features**: Conditional branching, loops, and sub-commands

## Task Packs

### **BUILDER-UI**: Visual Flow Builder Interface
**Objective**: Create React-based drag-and-drop command builder with step configuration panels.

### **SCHEMA-EXPORT**: Machine-Readable Step Metadata
**Objective**: Generate TypeScript interfaces and validation schemas from StepFactory for UI integration.

### **STORAGE-SYSTEM**: User Command Storage and Management
**Objective**: Database schema and API endpoints for user-authored commands with versioning.

### **FLOW-FEATURES**: Advanced Flow Control Capabilities
**Objective**: Visual editor for conditional branching, loops, and command composition.

## Success Criteria
- **User Adoption**: Users can create functional commands via UI within 10 minutes
- **Feature Parity**: Visual builder supports all existing DSL step types
- **Performance**: Command creation and editing responds within 200ms
- **Reliability**: User-created commands execute with same reliability as system commands

## Dependencies
- Sprint 50: Deterministic foundation and utility steps
- Sprint 51: Enhanced error handling for robust flows
- React/TypeScript frontend stack
- Database schema for user command storage

## Sprint Deliverables
1. Visual flow builder React component
2. Step configuration form system
3. Real-time validation and preview
4. User command storage and versioning
5. Advanced flow control features (conditionals, loops)
6. Command testing and deployment workflow
