# Sprint 47: Command System Continuation & Optimization

## Sprint Overview
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Focus**: Continue command system unification using Sprint 46 foundations  
**Priority**: High - Build on proven Sprint 46 success

## Sprint Objectives

### **Primary Goal**: Complete Medium-Complexity Command Migrations
Using the proven patterns and enhanced DSL framework from Sprint 46, systematically migrate remaining medium-complexity commands while maintaining zero functionality regression.

### **Secondary Goal**: Resolve Remaining Command Conflicts  
Address the remaining command conflicts (`todo`, `inbox`, `search`) using the successful conflict resolution pattern established with the `recall` command unification.

## Sprint Tasks

### **ENG-09-01: Remaining Conflict Resolution** (2-3 hours)
**Priority**: High  
**Objective**: Resolve remaining command conflicts using proven unification patterns

- **`todo` Command Unification**: Merge hardcoded CRUD operations with YAML AI-assisted creation
- **`inbox` Command Unification**: Combine multi-view system with API documentation features  
- **`search` Command Unification**: Integrate advanced filtering with basic search capabilities

**Success Criteria**:
- 3 unified commands replacing 6 conflicting implementations
- Full feature parity maintained for all existing functionality
- Backward compatibility preserved

### **ENG-09-02: Medium-Complexity Command Migration** (3-4 hours)
**Priority**: High  
**Objective**: Migrate straightforward commands using established DSL patterns

**Target Commands**:
- **`bookmark`**: Fragment bookmarking and management
- **`join`**: Channel/workspace joining functionality  
- **`channels`**: Channel listing and management
- **`routing`**: Request routing and navigation
- **`session`**: Session management operations

**Success Criteria**:
- 5 commands successfully migrated to YAML DSL
- Performance maintained or improved
- All aliases and shortcuts functional
- Zero functionality regression

### **ENG-09-03: Performance Analysis & Optimization** (1-2 hours)
**Priority**: Medium  
**Objective**: Analyze migration performance and optimize DSL framework

**Activities**:
- Benchmark migrated commands vs original implementations
- Identify performance bottlenecks in DSL execution
- Implement targeted optimizations for command loading
- Document performance improvements

**Success Criteria**:
- Performance benchmarks documented
- DSL execution optimized for production
- Command loading times improved
- Memory usage optimized

## Technical Foundation

### **Established from Sprint 46**
- ✅ **12-step DSL framework** with proven capability
- ✅ **Enhanced template engine** with expressions and control structures
- ✅ **Migration patterns documented** for systematic approach
- ✅ **Conflict resolution strategy** proven with `recall` unification
- ✅ **Zero regression testing** validated and operational

### **Available DSL Steps for Sprint 47**
- `fragment.query` - Advanced database queries
- `fragment.update` - Fragment modification
- `condition` - Branching logic
- `response.panel` - UI panel responses
- `database.update` - Direct database operations
- `validate` - Input validation
- `job.dispatch` - Background job processing
- Plus all original steps (transform, ai.generate, fragment.create, etc.)

## Expected Outcomes

### **Technical Deliverables**
- **8 additional commands migrated** (3 unified + 5 medium-complexity)
- **Comprehensive performance analysis** with optimization results
- **Enhanced migration documentation** based on Sprint 47 experience

### **System Impact**
- **75% command migration completion** (11 of 18 commands migrated)
- **Zero dual-system conflicts** remaining
- **Improved system performance** through optimization
- **Simplified command development** workflow established

### **Strategic Progress**
- **Proven scalability** of DSL framework approach
- **Clear roadmap** for remaining complex commands
- **Performance validation** for production readiness
- **Team confidence** in systematic migration approach

## Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
- **Complexity Escalation**: Use Sprint 46 patterns to maintain predictable complexity
- **Performance Impact**: Continuous benchmarking and optimization
- **Regression Risk**: Comprehensive testing at each migration step

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Pattern Replication**: Strict adherence to proven Sprint 46 patterns
- **Incremental Testing**: Validate each command migration individually
- **Rollback Planning**: Maintain dual system until all validations complete

## Success Metrics

### **Quantitative Targets**
- [ ] 8 commands successfully migrated with zero regression
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved across all migrations
- [ ] 100% test coverage for all migrated commands
- [ ] Documentation complete for all new patterns

### **Qualitative Targets**
- [ ] Team confidence in systematic migration approach
- [ ] Clear patterns established for future complex command migrations
- [ ] Strategic foundation ready for final complex command phase
- [ ] Production-ready DSL framework validation

## Post-Sprint Planning

### **Sprint 48 Preparation**
Based on Sprint 47 outcomes, prepare for final complex command migrations:
- **`vault`**: Security operations and access control
- **`project`**: Context management and workspace integration
- **`context`**: Session state and complex validation
- **`compose`**: AI integration and template processing

### **System Cleanup Planning** 
Validate readiness for comprehensive system cleanup (ENG-08-04) based on migration completion percentage and performance analysis.

Sprint 47 represents the systematic continuation of Sprint 46's success, building toward complete command system unification with confidence and proven patterns.
