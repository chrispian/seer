# Customization Foundation Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Architecture Design and Planning
**Duration**: 4-6 hours
- [ ] Design layout slot system architecture
- [ ] Plan user preference storage strategy
- [ ] Design widget positioning and arrangement system
- [ ] Create customization state management plan
- [ ] Define extensibility points for future features

## Phase 2: Layout Slot System Implementation
**Duration**: 6-8 hours
- [ ] Implement slot-based layout system
- [ ] Create widget slot containers and positioning logic
- [ ] Update RightRail with slot-based widget arrangement
- [ ] Implement slot registration and management
- [ ] Create slot validation and fallback mechanisms

## Phase 3: User Preference Storage
**Duration**: 4-6 hours
- [ ] Implement localStorage-based preference storage
- [ ] Create user preference schema and validation
- [ ] Implement preference loading and saving mechanisms
- [ ] Add preference migration and versioning
- [ ] Create preference reset and fallback functionality

## Phase 4: Customization State Management
**Duration**: 3-4 hours
- [ ] Integrate customization with Zustand store
- [ ] Implement layout state management
- [ ] Create customization actions and reducers
- [ ] Add state persistence and hydration
- [ ] Implement real-time layout updates

## Phase 5: Widget Arrangement Framework
**Duration**: 4-6 hours
- [ ] Implement widget reordering logic
- [ ] Create widget visibility toggle system
- [ ] Add layout density options
- [ ] Implement widget position validation
- [ ] Create arrangement preview and confirmation

## Phase 6: Basic Customization UI
**Duration**: 4-6 hours
- [ ] Create basic customization interface
- [ ] Implement widget reordering controls
- [ ] Add layout reset functionality
- [ ] Create customization settings panel
- [ ] Implement layout preview functionality

## Phase 7: Testing and Integration
**Duration**: 3-4 hours
- [ ] Test customization persistence across sessions
- [ ] Validate layout arrangements across breakpoints
- [ ] Test performance during customization operations
- [ ] Verify accessibility during customization
- [ ] Integration testing with existing widget system

## Phase 8: Documentation and Future Readiness
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
- [ ] Document customization API and architecture
- [ ] Create usage examples and patterns
- [ ] Document extension points for future features
- [ ] Create migration guide for drag-and-drop integration
- [ ] Establish customization best practices

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Slot-based layout system operational
- [ ] User preferences persist across browser sessions
- [ ] Basic widget reordering functionality working
- [ ] Layout customization doesn't break existing functionality
- [ ] Performance maintained during customization operations
- [ ] Foundation ready for drag-and-drop enhancement
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Future Enhancement Preparation
- [ ] API designed for drag-and-drop library integration
- [ ] State management ready for advanced features
- [ ] Database persistence preparation (schema design)
- [ ] Widget plugin system preparation
- [ ] Advanced layout algorithm preparation

## Risk Mitigation
- Incremental implementation with frequent testing
- Fallback to default layout if customization fails
- Performance monitoring during layout changes
- Comprehensive validation of user preferences
- Backup and restore functionality for layouts
