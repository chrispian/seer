# Sprint 53: Fragment Processing Pipeline Unification Foundation

## Overview
Unify chat and fragment processing through a shared orchestrator that enables deterministic processing, cost control, and reuse. Transform chat-driven fragment ingestion from bypassing the full pipeline to leveraging unified services.

## Sprint Goals
1. **Pipeline Unification**: Create shared orchestrator for both user and assistant chat fragments
2. **Chat Fragment Integration**: Enable full processing pipeline (embeddings, classification, tagging) for chat
3. **Cost Control Implementation**: Prioritize deterministic processing over AI with intelligent fallbacks
4. **Performance Optimization**: Maintain <500ms chat response time while adding full processing

## Current State Analysis
- **Chat Bypass**: Chat fragments skip classification, tagging, vault routing, and embeddings
- **Minimal Processing**: `CreateChatFragment` creates basic log fragments without enrichment
- **AI Waste**: AI enrichment runs even when deterministic results are available
- **Embeddings Disabled**: Vector recall capabilities completely unused for chat
- **Hard-coded Context**: System prompts are static instead of dynamic

## Task Packs

### **PIPELINE-001**: Fragment Processing Orchestrator
**Objective**: Create unified `FragmentProcessingOrchestrator` that routes both chat and regular fragments through shared pipeline while maintaining performance.

### **PIPELINE-002**: Chat Fragment Processing Integration
**Objective**: Integrate chat fragments into full processing pipeline with embeddings, classification, and tagging enabled.

### **PIPELINE-003**: Cost Control & Deterministic Priority
**Objective**: Implement intelligent cost controls that prioritize deterministic processing over AI with configurable thresholds.

## Success Metrics
- **Functionality**: Chat fragments receive full processing pipeline (embeddings, classification, tagging)
- **Performance**: Maintain <500ms response time for chat interactions
- **Cost Efficiency**: 40% reduction in AI calls through deterministic-first processing
- **Compatibility**: Zero regression in existing fragment functionality
- **Observability**: Complete processing metrics and debugging capabilities

## Dependencies
- Existing fragment processing pipeline (`ProcessFragmentJob`)
- Chat API infrastructure (`ChatApiController`, `CreateChatFragment`)
- Embeddings configuration system (`config/fragments.php`)
- AI model selection service (`ModelSelectionService`)

## Sprint Deliverables
1. **Unified Processing Orchestrator** - Single service for all fragment processing
2. **Enhanced Chat Fragment Pipeline** - Full processing for chat fragments
3. **Intelligent Cost Controls** - Deterministic-first processing with AI fallbacks
4. **Performance Monitoring** - Metrics and observability for processing pipeline
5. **Configuration Framework** - Flexible settings for processing behavior

## Risk Mitigation
- **Performance Impact**: Incremental rollout with real-time monitoring
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing APIs during transition
- **Cost Control**: Circuit breakers and usage monitoring
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive testing with existing fragment data

This sprint establishes the foundation for intelligent fragment processing that serves as the backbone for enhanced chat experiences while maintaining cost efficiency and performance.
