# YAML Command Migration Completion Plan

## Phase 1: Investigation & Analysis (Day 1)

### 1.1 Current State Audit
- [ ] Document all hardcoded commands in `CommandRegistry.php`
- [ ] Inventory all YAML commands in `fragments/commands/`
- [ ] Identify commands that exist in both systems
- [ ] Map command aliases and shortcuts

### 1.2 System Architecture Analysis  
- [ ] Investigate `CommandPackLoader` functionality
- [ ] Trace YAML command loading and registration flow
- [ ] Analyze frontend slash command routing (`SlashCommandService`)
- [ ] Document why YAML commands weren't accessible in recent issue

### 1.3 Feature Parity Assessment
- [ ] Compare each PHP command with its YAML equivalent
- [ ] Identify missing features or behavioral differences
- [ ] Document response format differences
- [ ] Test parameter handling and validation

## Phase 2: YAML Command Implementation (Days 2-3)

### 2.1 Missing Command Implementation
- [ ] Implement missing YAML versions of hardcoded commands
- [ ] Ensure all command aliases work in YAML
- [ ] Validate parameter parsing and validation
- [ ] Test response formatting matches PHP versions

### 2.2 Feature Gap Resolution
- [ ] Implement missing features in existing YAML commands
- [ ] Ensure database interactions work correctly
- [ ] Validate complex command workflows
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases

### 2.3 Integration Testing
- [ ] Test YAML commands through frontend interface
- [ ] Verify slash command autocomplete works
- [ ] Test command help and documentation
- [ ] Validate orchestration commands remain unaffected

## Phase 3: Migration Execution (Day 4)

### 3.1 Gradual Migration Testing
- [ ] Create test environment with YAML-only commands
- [ ] Run comprehensive command test suite
- [ ] Performance benchmark all commands
- [ ] User acceptance testing with key workflows

### 3.2 System Cutover Preparation
- [ ] Document rollback procedure
- [ ] Prepare monitoring for command execution
- [ ] Create migration checklist
- [ ] Backup current system state

### 3.3 Production Migration
- [ ] Disable hardcoded commands in `CommandRegistry.php`
- [ ] Monitor command execution rates and errors
- [ ] Validate all user workflows work
- [ ] Address any immediate issues

## Phase 4: Cleanup & Validation (Day 5)

### 4.1 System Cleanup
- [ ] Remove commented-out commands from `CommandRegistry.php`
- [ ] Clean up unused command classes
- [ ] Update system documentation
- [ ] Archive legacy command code

### 4.2 Final Validation
- [ ] Run full regression test suite
- [ ] Performance validation vs baseline
- [ ] User experience validation
- [ ] Documentation accuracy review

### 4.3 Documentation & Handoff
- [ ] Update architectural documentation
- [ ] Document migration lessons learned
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Team knowledge transfer

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Command Loading**: YAML commands not accessible
   - Mitigation: Thorough investigation of loading mechanism
   - Fallback: Hybrid approach if needed

2. **Feature Gaps**: Missing functionality in YAML versions
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive feature comparison
   - Fallback: Extend YAML DSL capabilities if needed

3. **Performance Regression**: YAML commands slower than PHP
   - Mitigation: Performance testing and optimization
   - Fallback: Optimize YAML processing if needed

4. **User Disruption**: Commands break during migration
   - Mitigation: Gradual migration with monitoring
   - Fallback: Quick rollback procedure

### Rollback Plan
1. Restore hardcoded commands in `CommandRegistry.php`
2. Disable problematic YAML commands
3. Monitor system recovery
4. Document issues for future resolution

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All commands accessible via YAML DSL only
- [ ] Zero functionality regressions
- [ ] Performance within 10% of baseline
- [ ] Clean, maintainable command architecture
- [ ] Complete documentation

## Dependencies
- YAML DSL system must be functional
- Frontend command routing must support YAML
- Command testing framework must be available
- Rollback procedures must be tested

## Estimated Timeline: 5 days
- Investigation: 1 day
- Implementation: 2 days
- Migration: 1 day
- Cleanup: 1 day

## Resources Needed
- Access to production command metrics
- Test environment for validation
- Coordination with frontend team
- QA support for comprehensive testing
