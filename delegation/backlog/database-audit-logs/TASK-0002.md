# TASK-0002: Implement Database Audit Logging System

## Status: Backlog

## Priority: High

## Problem
Database was reset to install state without proper audit trail. Need comprehensive logging of all database operations to prevent future incidents and enable proper incident investigation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Audit Log Table**
   - Create `audit_logs` table with fields: id, user_id, operation, table_name, record_id, old_values, new_values, ip_address, user_agent, timestamp
   - Add proper indexing for performance
   - Implement retention policy (90 days rolling)

2. **Database Operation Logging**
   - Hook into Eloquent model events (creating, updating, deleting)
   - Log raw database queries executed via DB facade
   - Capture migration executions
   - Log seeder executions

3. **Command Audit Logging**
   - Log all artisan command executions
   - Capture command name, arguments (sanitized), execution time
   - Track success/failure status
   - Alert on destructive commands

4. **User Attribution**
   - Track authenticated user ID for operations
   - Support system/API key operations
   - Capture session information
   - Log IP address and user agent

5. **Alerting System**
   - Real-time alerts for destructive operations
   - Configurable alert rules
   - Integration with existing monitoring
   - Escalation for critical operations

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance impact < 5% on database operations
- Async logging to prevent blocking
- Secure storage of audit data
- GDPR compliance for user data

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema & Core Logging
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
    operation VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    table_name VARCHAR(100) NULL,
    record_id VARCHAR(100) NULL,
    old_values JSON NULL,
    new_values JSON NULL,
    query TEXT NULL,
    ip_address VARCHAR(45) NULL,
    user_agent TEXT NULL,
    session_id VARCHAR(100) NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_user_operation (user_id, operation),
    INDEX idx_table_record (table_name, record_id),
    INDEX idx_created_at (created_at)
);
```

### Phase 2: Eloquent Model Observers
- Create `AuditObserver` class
- Register on all models that need auditing
- Capture before/after states for updates

### Phase 3: Query Logging
- Extend DB connection to log queries
- Sanitize sensitive data from logs
- Batch log inserts for performance

### Phase 4: Command Logging
- Create `CommandLoggingServiceProvider`
- Hook into artisan command lifecycle
- Log command execution details

### Phase 5: Alerting
- Create `AuditAlertService`
- Define alert rules configuration
- Integrate with notification system

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for audit logging components
- Integration tests for end-to-end logging
- Performance tests to ensure < 5% impact
- Security tests for data sanitization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All database operations are logged with user attribution
- [ ] Audit logs are tamper-proof and retained for 90 days
- [ ] Destructive operations trigger real-time alerts
- [ ] Admin can search and filter audit logs
- [ ] Performance impact is within acceptable limits
- [ ] System can handle high-volume operations

## Dependencies
- Database migration for audit_logs table
- Notification system for alerts
- Admin UI for log viewing

## Estimated Effort
- Phase 1: 3 days (schema + core logging)
- Phase 2: 2 days (model observers)
- Phase 3: 2 days (query logging)
- Phase 4: 1 day (command logging)
- Phase 5: 2 days (alerting)
- Testing: 2 days

**Total: 12 days**

## Risks
- Performance degradation during high load
- Storage space requirements for logs
- Privacy concerns with detailed logging

## Notes
This task addresses the root cause of the database reset incident by ensuring all destructive operations are properly tracked and can be investigated.
