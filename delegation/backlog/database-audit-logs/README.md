# Database Audit Logging System

## Problem Statement
The database was unexpectedly reset to install state, indicating a lack of comprehensive audit logging for destructive database operations. While we've implemented basic tool blocking, we need a complete audit system to track all database operations for accountability and debugging.

## Current State
- ✅ Basic tool blocking implemented in ShellTool
- ✅ User confirmation required for destructive operations
- ✅ Tool execution audit logging added
- ❌ No comprehensive database operation logging
- ❌ No user attribution for direct database operations
- ❌ No alerting for unauthorized destructive operations

## Requirements

### 1. Database Operation Audit Logging
- Log all direct database operations (migrations, seeders, raw queries)
- Capture user context (ID, IP, session)
- Log operation type, affected tables, row counts
- Store in dedicated audit table with retention policy

### 2. Command Audit Logging
- Log all artisan command executions
- Capture command arguments (sanitized)
- Track execution time and success/failure
- Alert on destructive command patterns

### 3. User Attribution System
- Track which user initiated each operation
- Support for both authenticated and system operations
- API key attribution for automated operations
- Session tracking for web-initiated operations

### 4. Alerting System
- Real-time alerts for destructive operations
- Configurable alert thresholds
- Integration with monitoring systems
- Escalation procedures for critical operations

### 5. Audit Trail UI
- Admin interface to view audit logs
- Filtering and search capabilities
- Export functionality for compliance
- Real-time monitoring dashboard

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Audit Infrastructure
1. Create `audit_logs` table with proper indexing
2. Implement `AuditLogger` service
3. Add database operation hooks
4. Create command execution middleware

### Phase 2: User Attribution
1. Update authentication system to track operations
2. Add context passing through request lifecycle
3. Implement API key attribution
4. Create user activity tracking

### Phase 3: Alerting & Monitoring
1. Create alert configuration system
2. Implement real-time alerting
3. Add monitoring dashboard
4. Create escalation procedures

### Phase 4: UI & Compliance
1. Build audit log viewer
2. Add export functionality
3. Implement retention policies
4. Create compliance reporting

## Success Criteria
- All database operations are logged with user attribution
- Destructive operations trigger alerts
- Audit logs are tamper-proof and retained appropriately
- Admin can easily investigate incidents
- System prevents future unauthorized data loss

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Performance Impact**: Use async logging and efficient storage
- **Storage Growth**: Implement retention policies and archiving
- **Privacy Concerns**: Sanitize sensitive data in logs
- **Alert Fatigue**: Configurable thresholds and smart filtering

## Dependencies
- Database schema changes
- Authentication system updates
- Monitoring infrastructure
- Admin UI framework

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks (core infrastructure)
- Phase 2: 1-2 weeks (user attribution)
- Phase 3: 1 week (alerting)
- Phase 4: 2 weeks (UI & compliance)

## Stakeholders
- Development team (implementation)
- DevOps (monitoring & alerting)
- Security team (compliance review)
- Product team (requirements validation)
