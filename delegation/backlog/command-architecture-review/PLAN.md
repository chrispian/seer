# Command Architecture Review - Implementation Plan

## Task Overview
**Objective**: Establish long-term command architecture strategy based on Sprint 46 outcomes  
**Timeline**: 2-3 hours total  
**Priority**: High - Strategic decision required  

## Phase 1: Strategic Review Session (1-2 hours)

### **1.1 Sprint 46 Outcome Analysis** (30 minutes)
- Review successful migrations (`clear`, `help`, `frag`, `recall` unification)
- Analyze challenges encountered (especially `name` command complexity)
- Document lessons learned and migration patterns established
- Assess DSL framework maturity and capability boundaries

### **1.2 Complexity Boundary Discussion** (30 minutes)
- Define command complexity classification system
- Establish criteria for DSL vs. hardcoded decisions
- Review specific complex commands (`vault`, `project`, `context`, `compose`)
- Identify technical indicators for migration approach

### **1.3 Strategic Direction Alignment** (30-60 minutes)
- Discuss long-term vision for command system architecture
- Evaluate investment levels in DSL framework expansion
- Consider hybrid approach pros/cons
- Align team on development philosophy and priorities

## Phase 2: Documentation Creation (30-45 minutes)

### **2.1 Architecture Guidelines Document**
Create comprehensive guidelines including:
- **Command Complexity Classification**
  - Simple: Template responses, basic CRUD → Pure DSL
  - Medium: Multi-step workflows, integrations → Enhanced DSL  
  - Complex: Deep framework integration → Hybrid/Hardcoded
- **Migration Decision Tree**
  - Complexity assessment criteria
  - Performance consideration thresholds
  - Maintenance overhead evaluation
- **Development Patterns**
  - DSL command templates and best practices
  - Hybrid command integration patterns
  - Hardcoded command maintenance guidelines

### **2.2 Investment Strategy Framework**
- ROI thresholds for DSL framework expansion
- Cost/benefit analysis criteria for complex features
- Resource allocation guidelines for different approaches

## Phase 3: Future Planning (30 minutes)

### **3.1 Migration Roadmap Prioritization**
Based on review outcomes, prioritize:
- **Remaining conflict resolutions** (`todo`, `inbox`, `search`)
- **Medium complexity commands** (using established patterns)
- **Complex commands** (based on strategic decisions)

### **3.2 DSL Framework Enhancement Planning**
- Identify specific enhancements needed based on strategic direction
- Plan implementation timeline for approved enhancements
- Document deferred enhancements and review triggers

### **3.3 Follow-up Planning**
- Schedule architectural review checkpoints
- Plan team training/documentation needs
- Establish monitoring and evaluation criteria

## Expected Outcomes

### **Strategic Clarity**
- Clear boundaries between DSL and hardcoded approaches
- Team alignment on architectural philosophy
- Investment strategy for framework expansion

### **Operational Guidelines**
- Decision criteria for future command development
- Documented patterns and best practices
- Clear migration and development workflows

### **Future Roadmap**
- Prioritized list of remaining migrations
- Timeline for strategic framework enhancements
- Success metrics and review checkpoints

## Success Criteria Validation
- [ ] Team consensus on architectural direction
- [ ] Documented decision criteria and guidelines
- [ ] Clear prioritization of remaining work
- [ ] Investment boundaries and strategy defined
- [ ] Next steps and timeline established

## Dependencies
- Sprint 46 completion documentation
- Team availability for review session
- Stakeholder alignment on priorities

## Deliverables
1. **Architecture Guidelines Document** - Decision criteria and patterns
2. **Migration Roadmap** - Prioritized remaining work
3. **Investment Strategy** - Framework enhancement boundaries
4. **Meeting Notes** - Decisions and rationale documentation

This review will transform Sprint 46's technical achievements into a clear strategic direction for continued command system evolution.
