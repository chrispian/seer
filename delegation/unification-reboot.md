All md docs referenced are in the root/docs folder

Read first: SPRINT_WORKFLOW_PROCESS.md

Before we proceed, let's harden against this a little bit more. Let's disable these entirely and if run, they should hard error with the reason and to seek further instruction from the user (user may temp enable or perform a task for the agent to achieve goal)
# Never use these without asking:
# php artisan migrate:fresh
# php artisan migrate:refresh
# php artisan db:wipe

Next, pull the demo seeder entirely. I want it extracted and and include the documentation about it. Put the backup in docs/demo-seeder-backup and log a task in the orchestration system to plan this feature better.

Then, let's regoup and rebuild our sprint/tasks, update them, and then we can proceed. This is exactly the dogfooding we need to make this system even better!

Based on our work, we likely lost (documentation onl):

‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ SPRINT-UNIFY-1 through SPRINT-UNIFY-5 (created at beginning)
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ T-UNIFY-01 through T-UNIFY-20 (all tasks)
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Task status updates (in_progress, completed)
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Task content (plan_content, summary_content, etc.)
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Sprint status changes and notes
‚Ä¢ ‚ùì Any existing data from before we started

## What We Created (Still Exists as Files)

These files are safe and don't need to be recreated:

‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ database/migrations/2025_10_10_133125_create_types_registry_table.php
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ database/migrations/2025_10_10_133216_create_commands_table.php
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ app/Models/Type.php
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ app/Models/Command.php
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ database/seeders/TypesSeeder.php
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ database/seeders/CommandsSeeder.php
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ All documentation files we created

After restoring backup:

1. Verify what sprint/task data exists
2. If needed, recreate sprints and tasks using the orchestration commands
3. Continue with Sprint 2 using safe migration practices
4. Only use migrate (not migrate:fresh) for future work

We completed Sprint 1 of the Type + Command Unification project:

### Tasks Completed (files exist, DB data lost):

1. T-UNIFY-01: Created types_registry migration with storage_type enum
2. T-UNIFY-02: Created commands table migration with availability flags
3. T-UNIFY-03: Created Type model with scopes and relationships
4. T-UNIFY-04: Created Command model with scopes and config methods
5. T-UNIFY-05: Created TypesSeeder (8 types) and CommandsSeeder (12
commands)

### Files Created:

‚Ä¢ database/migrations/2025_10_10_133125_create_types_registry_table.php
‚Ä¢ database/migrations/2025_10_10_133216_create_commands_table.php
‚Ä¢ app/Models/Type.php
‚Ä¢ app/Models/Command.php
‚Ä¢ database/seeders/TypesSeeder.php
‚Ä¢ database/seeders/CommandsSeeder.php

### Architecture Established:

‚Ä¢ Types: Define data (model-backed or fragment-backed)
‚Ä¢ Commands: Define actions (controller layer)
‚Ä¢ storage_type enum: Key innovation distinguishing model vs fragment types]





This was the last update from the previous agent:


# üéâ SPRINT 1 COMPLETE! üéâ

## Schema & DB Foundation - ALL TASKS COMPLETE ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ T-UNIFY-01: types_registry Migration

‚Ä¢ Created migration with storage_type enum (model/fragment)
‚Ä¢ Added model_class, schema, UI config fields
‚Ä¢ Proper indexes for performance

### ‚úÖ T-UNIFY-02: commands Table Migration

‚Ä¢ Full command routing schema
‚Ä¢ Availability flags (slash/CLI/MCP)
‚Ä¢ UI configuration fields
‚Ä¢ Foreign key to types_registry

### ‚úÖ T-UNIFY-03: Type Model

‚Ä¢ Scopes: enabled(), modelBacked(), fragmentBacked()
‚Ä¢ Relationships: commands(), fragments()
‚Ä¢ Helper methods for type checking and model instantiation

### ‚úÖ T-UNIFY-04: Command Model

‚Ä¢ Scopes: availableInSlash(), availableInCli(), availableInMcp()
‚Ä¢ Relationship: type()
‚Ä¢ Config methods: getFullConfig(), getCardComponent()

### ‚úÖ T-UNIFY-05: Seeders

‚Ä¢ TypesSeeder: 8 types (5 model, 3 fragment)
‚Ä¢ CommandsSeeder: 12 commands
‚Ä¢ All data tested and working

## Database Verified ‚úÖ

‚Ä¢ 8 types in types_registry
‚Ä¢ 12 commands in commands table
‚Ä¢ Migrations run successfully
‚Ä¢ Seeders execute cleanly

---

## Sprint 1 Status: COMPLETED

Duration: ~2 hours Tasks Completed: 5/5 (100%) Deliverable: Clean DB schema
with seeded data ‚úÖ

Ready for Sprint 2: Command System Refactor

Thankfully we've got a pretty good system and not much is lost. Here are the docs you'll need to recreate any sprint data we need and a strong context pack to get you up to speed:

UNIFICATION_READY_TO_START.md
UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md
UNIFICATION_SPRINT_SUMMARY.md
