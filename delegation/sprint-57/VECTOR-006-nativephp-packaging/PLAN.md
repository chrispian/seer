# Implementation Plan: NativePHP Packaging & Testing

## Overview
Package sqlite-vec extension with NativePHP builds to enable embedded vector search in desktop applications.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Extension Bundling (2h)
- Download sqlite-vec extension for Windows/macOS/Linux
- Add extension files to NativePHP build resources
- Configure build pipeline to include extensions
- Test extension loading in development environment

### Step 2: Automatic Loading (1h)
- Configure SQLite to automatically load sqlite-vec extension
- Add NativePHP-specific configuration for vector features
- Implement graceful fallback if extension loading fails
- Test extension initialization in packaged app

### Step 3: Build Pipeline Integration (1h)
- Update NativePHP build configuration
- Add platform-specific extension handling
- Configure CI/CD for automated builds
- Test builds across all target platforms

### Step 4: Testing & Validation (1-2h)
- Test vector search functionality in packaged app
- Validate performance in desktop environment
- Test offline functionality
- Create deployment documentation

## Dependencies
- All VECTOR tasks must be completed
- NativePHP build environment configured
- sqlite-vec extension binaries available

## Deliverables
- Vector-enabled NativePHP builds for all platforms
- Automated build pipeline
- Deployment and troubleshooting documentation
- Performance validation report
