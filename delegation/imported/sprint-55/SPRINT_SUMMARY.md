# Sprint 55: Agent & Embeddings Integration

## Overview
Complete the fragment processing pipeline transformation by implementing Agent Broker for intelligent model selection, reviving the embeddings system for enhanced search and recall, and optimizing prompts for cost efficiency and better results.

## Sprint Goals
1. **Agent Broker Implementation**: Deterministic agent/model selection based on project, vault, and task context
2. **Embeddings System Revival**: Enable comprehensive embeddings with vector + fulltext search capability
3. **Prompt Optimization**: Clean up prompts, reduce token usage, and implement intelligent AI usage controls
4. **Complete Integration**: Finalize the unified pipeline with all broker services working together

## Current State Analysis
- **Static Model Selection**: Hard-coded model choices instead of context-aware selection
- **Embeddings Disabled**: `EMBEDDINGS_ENABLED=false` disables vector search and recall
- **Prompt Inefficiency**: Generic prompts waste tokens and provide poor context
- **Fragmented AI Usage**: No central intelligence for when and how to use AI services
- **Missing Vector Search**: No semantic search capabilities for chat and fragment recall

## Task Packs

### **AGENT-001**: Agent Broker Implementation
**Objective**: Implement intelligent agent/model selection that considers project context, user preferences, vault settings, and task requirements.

### **EMBED-001**: Embeddings System Revival
**Objective**: Enable embeddings with local/Ollama support, implement combined vector + fulltext search, and optimize for real-time chat performance.

### **PROMPT-001**: Prompt Optimization & Cost Controls
**Objective**: Optimize prompts for efficiency, implement intelligent AI usage controls, and reduce unnecessary token consumption.

## Success Metrics
- **Smart Agent Selection**: Context-aware model/agent routing improves response quality
- **Vector Search Active**: Embeddings enabled with sub-200ms search performance
- **Cost Reduction**: 30% reduction in token usage through prompt optimization
- **Enhanced Recall**: Vector + fulltext search provides relevant context for chat
- **User Control**: UI allows agent/model overrides with intelligent defaults
- **System Intelligence**: Complete pipeline makes smart decisions about processing

## Dependencies
- Sprint 53: Unified processing pipeline foundation
- Sprint 54: Context and Tool Brokers for enhanced integration
- Local embedding models (Ollama/nomic-embed-text)
- Enhanced model selection infrastructure

## Sprint Deliverables
1. **Agent Broker Service** - Context-aware agent/model selection with UI integration
2. **Embeddings Infrastructure** - Comprehensive embedding generation and search
3. **Optimized Prompt System** - Efficient, context-aware prompts with cost controls
4. **Vector Search Implementation** - Combined semantic and fulltext search capabilities
5. **Complete Pipeline Integration** - All brokers working together seamlessly
6. **Performance Monitoring** - Comprehensive metrics for the complete system

## Integration Architecture
```
User Request → Context Broker → Agent Broker → Model Selection
     ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓
Tool Analysis → Intent Detection → Command Routing → Execution
     ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓
Content Processing → Embeddings → Vector Search → Enhanced Response
     ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓
Response Assembly ← Cost Controls ← Prompt Optimization ← Final Output
```

## Risk Mitigation
- **Embedding Performance**: Local models and optimized batch processing
- **Model Availability**: Graceful fallbacks when preferred models unavailable
- **Cost Control**: Comprehensive monitoring and circuit breakers
- **Search Accuracy**: Hybrid vector + fulltext approach for best results
- **System Complexity**: Comprehensive testing and monitoring for all components

This sprint completes the transformation of the fragment processing pipeline into an intelligent, context-aware system that provides superior user experience while maintaining cost efficiency and performance.
