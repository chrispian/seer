# Implementation Summary

## Outcomes
- Introduced `App\Enums\AgentType`, `AgentMode`, and `AgentStatus` with helper metadata so downstream CLI/UI flows have consistent copy and defaults.
- Added `App\Models\AgentProfile` with UUID keys, JSON casts, relationship accessors (assignments, assigned tasks), query scopes, and lifecycle hooks for slug/mode inference.
- Delivered `App\Services\AgentProfileService` covering listing/filtering, CRUD with validation, lifecycle helpers (archive/activate/delete), and catalog exports.
- Seeded `Database\Factories\AgentProfileFactory` and Pest coverage in `tests/Unit/AgentProfileServiceTest.php` validating creation, updates, filtering, and slug uniqueness.

## Testing
- `./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/AgentProfileServiceTest.php`

## Next Steps
- Use `AgentProfileService` in ORCH-01-03 delegation migration to import agents from file-based packs.
- Surface the service in ORCH-01-04 CLI commands and upcoming MCP tools.
- Consider audit/history tables once assignment workflows land (Sprintâ€¯63+).
