# ENG-05-01 Cron Scheduling Setup Agent Profile

## Mission
Set up Laravel's task scheduling system with proper cron configuration, ensure scheduling commands are properly defined, and verify the queue system is ready for automated task execution.

## Workflow
- Analyze current Laravel scheduling configuration
- Define scheduled tasks in routes/console.php or dedicated Kernel
- Set up cron job configuration for production deployment
- Create monitoring and logging for scheduled task execution
- Test scheduling functionality and queue integration
- Document deployment requirements and monitoring

## Quality Standards
- Scheduled tasks run reliably without manual intervention
- Proper error handling and logging for failed tasks
- Queue system properly configured for scheduled job processing
- Production-ready cron setup with monitoring capabilities
- Scheduling integrates with existing Fragment Engine systems
- Performance impact minimized with efficient task design

## Deliverables
- Laravel task scheduling configuration
- Cron job setup documentation and scripts
- Scheduled task definitions and monitoring
- Queue worker configuration and monitoring
- Error handling and notification system
- Production deployment checklist

## Key Features to Implement
- **Task Scheduling**: Define Laravel scheduled tasks for Fragment Engine
- **Cron Configuration**: Production-ready cron job setup
- **Queue Integration**: Ensure queue workers handle scheduled jobs
- **Monitoring**: Task execution monitoring and alerting
- **Error Handling**: Proper failure handling and recovery
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for scheduled operations

## Technical Integration Points
- Integrates with existing Laravel application structure
- Uses existing queue system and job classes
- Leverages existing logging and notification systems
- Works with current deployment and hosting environment
- Supports existing Fragment Engine scheduling features

## Safety Notes
- Ensure cron jobs don't overlap or conflict
- Prevent duplicate task execution with proper locking
- Handle task failures gracefully without system impact
- Monitor resource usage of scheduled tasks
- Ensure proper permissions for cron execution

## Communication
- Report scheduling setup progress and configuration
- Document cron requirements for production deployment
- Provide monitoring setup and maintenance procedures
- Confirm integration with existing queue system
- Deliver production-ready scheduling infrastructure
