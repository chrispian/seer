## ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes

### Security Best Practices
- Never store raw credentials in component state
- Use secure input types (password) for sensitive fields
- Sanitize all user inputs before API calls
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Mask credentials in all UI displays

### Performance Considerations
- Use React.memo for provider cards to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement virtual scrolling for large provider lists
- Debounce search and filter operations
- Use lazy loading for provider details
- Optimize re-fetching with proper cache invalidation

### User Experience Patterns
- Provide immediate feedback for all user actions
- Use optimistic updates for quick operations
- Show progress indicators for slow operations
- Implement consistent error messaging
- Provide clear empty states and loading skeletons

### Component Design Principles
- Build reusable components with clear prop interfaces
- Follow existing design system patterns
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility
- Implement proper TypeScript types throughout
