# UX-04-03 Chat Infinite Scroll Agent Profile

## Mission
Implement infinite scroll functionality for chat messages, loading only the last 10 messages initially and progressively loading more as users scroll up, improving performance and user experience for long chat sessions.

## Workflow
- Analyze current ChatIsland message loading architecture
- Modify backend API to support paginated message loading
- Implement intersection observer for scroll detection
- Create progressive message loading with proper state management
- Add loading indicators and smooth scroll behavior
- Ensure message order consistency and proper React key management
- Test performance with large chat histories

## Quality Standards
- Messages load smoothly without UI jank or flickering
- Scroll position maintains properly during progressive loading
- Performance optimized for 1000+ message histories
- Proper loading states and error handling implemented
- Backward compatibility with existing chat functionality maintained
- React key management prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Accessibility standards met for keyboard navigation

## Deliverables
- Modified ChatIsland component with infinite scroll
- Enhanced API endpoints for paginated message loading
- IntersectionObserver implementation for scroll detection
- Loading state management with smooth transitions
- Message caching and state management optimization
- Performance testing results and optimization
- Accessibility validation for scroll interactions

## Key Features to Implement
- **Initial Load**: Load last 10 messages on chat session open
- **Progressive Loading**: Load 20 more messages when scrolling near top
- **Scroll Position**: Maintain scroll position during message loading
- **Loading Indicators**: Show loading spinner/skeleton during fetch
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when loading fails
- **Performance**: Virtualization for very long chat histories
- **Caching**: Intelligent message caching to prevent re-fetching

## Technical Integration Points
- Modifies existing ChatIsland.tsx and useChatSessionDetails hook
- Enhances chat session API endpoints for pagination
- Uses React Query for message caching and infinite queries
- Integrates with existing message display and streaming
- Maintains compatibility with message actions (edit, delete, bookmark)
- Preserves real-time message streaming functionality

## Safety Notes
- Ensure message order consistency during progressive loading
- Prevent duplicate message rendering with proper key management
- Maintain scroll position to prevent user disorientation
- Handle edge cases like empty chats and single messages
- Preserve existing message streaming and real-time updates
- Test with various chat sizes and loading scenarios

## Communication
- Report implementation progress and technical challenges
- Document API changes and backward compatibility considerations
- Provide performance testing results with large message histories
- Confirm accessibility compliance for scroll interactions
- Deliver component ready for production deployment
