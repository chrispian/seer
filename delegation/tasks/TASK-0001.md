We have custom types like log, contact, todo, etc. Combined with custom slash commands used in the chat composer island via the tiptap editor. The types define how these actions should work and display things. I want to work on a couple of other tasks that require a couple of improvements to types. #1 In the UI, we need to specify a component to display that item. I think this should be a keyed array and allow us to specify one for any command. eg: default:card-component, search:smol-card-component, and so on. if default is not set, it will use the default fragment card. #2 One of the commands I want to bring back is the recall command. It has a syntax like \/recall type:todo limit:5 *Escaed to avoid triggering here. (type into the chat composer. This behavior used to work. I believe the old versions of the files are still in this branch. When I use that command, I get this error - please investigate and report your findings/suggestions. Oh, on recall, we need to specifiy the component for when that type is used in a recall command. So in the recall config, an array of types:components like for #1 of this task. We have an orchestration tools in this code base, please access it and use it to create tasks and then keep those tasks updated through out and at the end. Finalize the plan and then create these tasks. There may already be a task for the recall - it will give you context hints. You can also search docs for more info.
