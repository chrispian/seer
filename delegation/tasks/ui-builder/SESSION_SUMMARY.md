# UI Builder v2 - Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-15  
**Duration**: ~4 hours  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE & READY FOR MERGE**

---

## What We Built

A fully functional **config-driven UI Builder v2** system with the **Agents Modal** as the working proof-of-concept.

### The Result
**Demo URL**: `/v2/pages/page.agent.table.modal`

Users can now:
1. **View agents** in a searchable table with avatars
2. **Search** in real-time (debounced, smooth)
3. **Create agents** via form modal with name, profile, persona, status, and avatar upload
4. **View details** by clicking any row - shows avatar, badges, and all fields
5. **No page reloads** - everything updates smoothly via SlotBinder

---

## Technical Achievement

### Architecture
- **Config-driven**: Pages defined in JSON, stored in database with hash versioning
- **Component registry**: Extensible system for React components
- **Action dispatcher**: Unified handling of commands, navigation, API calls, modals
- **Slot binder**: Pub/sub for component communication
- **Direct v2 APIs**: Clean REST endpoints under `/api/v2/ui/*`

### Components Built
1. **TableComponent** - Paginated, searchable, with skeleton loaders
2. **SearchBarComponent** - Debounced with slot binding
3. **ButtonIconComponent** - Multi-action support
4. **FormModal** - Dynamic fields (text, textarea, select, file)
5. **DetailComponent** - Avatar, badges, formatted fields

### Backend Infrastructure
- 4 database tables with auto-hash/version
- `AgentDataSourceResolver` with search/filter/sort
- `AgentController` with file upload support
- Seeder for demo data
- Scaffold command (ready but not used)

- Refresh table without page reload

### Hour 4: Detail View & Polish
- Created DetailComponent with avatar/badges
- Wired row clicks to detail modal
- Fixed avatar display in table and detail
- Comprehensive documentation
- Created PR

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Bypass Command System
**Decision**: Use direct v2 API routes instead of existing command system  
**Reason**: Simpler, cleaner separation, easier to extend  
**Impact**: Faster development, clear v2 namespace

### 2. Skeleton Loaders as Default
**Decision**: Always show skeleton UI during loading  
**Reason**: Eliminates flicker, improves perceived performance  
**Impact**: Professional feel, better UX (ADR documented)

### 3. SlotBinder for Component Communication
**Decision**: Pub/sub pattern instead of prop drilling  
**Reason**: Decoupled components, flexible data flow  
**Impact**: Search ‚Üí Table refresh, Form ‚Üí Table refresh work seamlessly

### 4. Config in Database (Not Files)
**Decision**: Store configs in `fe_ui_pages` table with hash versioning  
**Reason**: Hot-swappable, versionable, auditable  
**Impact**: Can update UIs without deployments

## Challenges Overcome

### Challenge 1: Infinite Loop in useDataSource
**Problem**: `options` object recreated every render, triggering useCallback  
**Solution**: Destructure to primitives, use primitive dependencies  
**Learning**: Object dependencies in hooks need careful handling

### Challenge 2: Modal Resize Flicker
**Problem**: Modal jumped from small to large when content loaded  
**Solution**: Set `min-w-[56rem] min-h-[32rem]` to match final size  
**Learning**: Pre-size containers to prevent layout shift

### Challenge 3: Page Reload Lag After Form Submit
**Problem**: `window.location.reload()` caused white fade/lag  
**Solution**: Use SlotBinder to refresh just the table component  
**Learning**: Targeted updates > full page reloads

### Challenge 4: Avatar Not Displaying
**Problem**: `avatar_url` accessor not included in API responses  
**Solution**: `$agent->append('avatar_url')` in controllers and resolver  
**Learning**: Laravel accessors need explicit appending in JSON responses

### Challenge 5: Agent Profile Required (NOT NULL)
**Problem**: Database constraint required profile, form didn't  
**Solution**: Default to first available profile in controller  
**Learning**: Check schema constraints, handle gracefully

‚úÖ Clear work orders with exit criteria  
‚úÖ Telemetry and status reports  
‚úÖ ADRs for key decisions  
‚úÖ Manual testing throughout  
‚úÖ Small, frequent commits  

### What Could Improve
‚ö†Ô∏è Should have written tests alongside features  
‚ö†Ô∏è TypeScript types could be tighter upfront  
‚ö†Ô∏è Could have used Storybook for component development  

### Technical Insights
üí° Config-driven UIs are powerful but need strong typing  
üí° Skeleton loaders are worth the effort (big UX win)  
üí° SlotBinder pattern works great for decoupled components  
üí° Direct APIs simpler than abstraction layers for MVPs  
üí° Avatar accessors need explicit appending in Laravel
