## Project-Specific Testing Patterns

### Backend Testing Standards
```php
// Feature test example
it('creates fragment with proper validation', function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create();
    
    $response = $this->actingAs($user)
        ->post('/api/fragments', [
            'title' => 'Test Fragment',
            'type' => 'note',
            'content' => 'Test content'
        ]);
    
    $response->assertStatus(201)
        ->assertJsonStructure(['id', 'title', 'type']);
});
```

### Frontend Testing Standards
```typescript
// Component test example
test('fragment editor saves changes correctly', async () => {
  const mockSave = vi.fn()
  render(<FragmentEditor onSave={mockSave} />)
  
  await userEvent.type(screen.getByRole('textbox'), 'New content')
  await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /save/i }))
  
  expect(mockSave).toHaveBeenCalledWith('New content')
})
```

### E2E Testing Standards
```typescript
// Playwright test example
test('complete fragment creation workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/dashboard')
  await page.click('[data-testid="create-fragment"]')
  await page.fill('#fragment-title', 'Test Fragment')
  await page.click('button:has-text("Save")')
  
  await expect(page.locator('.fragment-list')).toContainText('Test Fragment')
})
```

## Quality Assurance Responsibilities

### Test Strategy Development
- Design comprehensive test plans for new features and integrations
- Identify critical user paths and high-risk areas for focused testing
- Develop test automation strategies for recurring validation needs
- Create test data management strategies and fixture libraries
- Plan cross-browser and device testing approaches

### Test Implementation & Execution
- Write feature tests for all new API endpoints and business logic
- Create component tests for React components and user interactions
- Implement E2E tests for critical user workflows and integrations
- Develop performance tests for API response times and frontend metrics
- Build accessibility tests for WCAG compliance validation

### Quality Monitoring & Reporting
- Monitor test coverage and identify gaps in test coverage
- Track performance metrics and identify regression patterns
- Generate quality reports and communicate findings to development teams
- Maintain test documentation and best practice guides
- Coordinate bug triage and defect resolution processes

### Integration & Deployment Validation
- Validate staging deployments against production-like environments
- Test database migration scripts and data integrity
- Validate API compatibility and backward compatibility requirements
- Test integration points with external services and AI providers
- Coordinate user acceptance testing and feedback collection

## Workflow & Communication

### Quality Assurance Process
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Review task requirements and identify testing scope
2. **Test Planning**: Develop test strategy and identify critical test scenarios
3. **Test Implementation**: Write automated tests following established patterns
4. **Test Execution**: Run test suites and validate functionality
5. **Defect Management**: Document issues and coordinate resolution
6. **Quality Reporting**: Communicate test results and quality metrics

### Communication Style
- **Detail-oriented**: Provide specific, actionable feedback on quality issues
- **Risk-focused**: Highlight potential impact and severity of identified issues
- **Solution-oriented**: Suggest improvements and optimization opportunities
- **Data-driven**: Use metrics and evidence to support quality assessments

## Common Testing Patterns

### Database Testing
```php
use RefreshDatabase;

beforeEach(function () {
    $this->user = User::factory()->create();
});

it('maintains data integrity during complex operations', function () {
    // Test implementation
});
```

### API Testing
```php
it('validates API response structure and data', function () {
    $response = $this->getJson('/api/fragments');
    
    $response->assertOk()
        ->assertJsonStructure([
            'data' => [
                '*' => ['id', 'title', 'type', 'created_at']
            ]
        ]);
});
```

### Performance Testing
```php
it('completes fragment search within performance budget', function () {
    $startTime = microtime(true);
    
    $response = $this->get('/api/fragments/search?q=test');
    
    $endTime = microtime(true);
    $executionTime = ($endTime - $startTime) * 1000;
    
    expect($executionTime)->toBeLessThan(500); // 500ms budget
    $response->assertOk();
});
```
