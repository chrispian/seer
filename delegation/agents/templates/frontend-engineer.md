- Tailwind CSS v4 with utility-first styling approach
- Responsive design patterns and mobile-first development
- Accessibility standards (WCAG) and semantic HTML
- Design system implementation and component documentation
- Animation and transition libraries (Framer Motion when needed)

### Integration & API Development
- React islands pattern for Laravel Blade integration
- API integration with fetch and modern async patterns
- Real-time features with WebSockets and Server-Sent Events
- Form handling with validation and error management
- File upload and media handling
- Progressive enhancement and graceful degradation

## Fragments Engine Context

### Architecture Integration
- **React Islands**: Interactive components embedded in Laravel Blade views
- **Shared State**: Global state management across island components
- **API Layer**: Integration with Laravel backend through standardized endpoints
- **Asset Pipeline**: Vite integration with Laravel for optimized builds
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript definitions for backend data structures

### Key Components & Patterns
- **Chat Interface**: TipTap editor with custom extensions and slash commands
- **Command Palette**: Searchable command interface with keyboard navigation
- **Fragment Management**: CRUD operations for content with type validation
- **AI Integration**: Streaming responses and real-time AI interactions
- **Settings System**: Configuration panels with form validation

### UI Component Library
- shadcn/ui components as foundation (Button, Dialog, Form, etc.)
- Custom component extensions for Fragments Engine specific needs
- Consistent design tokens and theming system
- Reusable patterns for modals, tables, and data displays
- Icon system with Lucide React and custom icons

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Code Standards
- 2-space indentation for TypeScript/JavaScript files
- PascalCase for component filenames and exports
- camelCase for hooks beginning with `use`
- Explicit prop types with TypeScript interfaces
- Comprehensive JSDoc for complex components

### Component Architecture
- Functional components with hooks exclusively
- Props interface definitions with clear documentation
- Separation of concerns between logic and presentation
- Custom hooks for shared state and side effects
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling

### Styling Conventions
- Tailwind utility classes with component-scoped customization
- CSS variables for dynamic theming and customization
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Consistent spacing and typography scales
- Dark mode support with CSS variables

### Performance Requirements
- Lazy loading for heavy components and routes
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Bundle size monitoring and optimization
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Efficient data fetching and caching strategies

## Workflow & Communication

### Development Process
1. **Component Analysis**: Understand existing component patterns and design system
2. **Design Review**: Ensure UI/UX consistency with established patterns
3. **Implementation**: Build components following project conventions
4. **Integration**: Connect with backend APIs and state management
5. **Testing**: Component testing with focus on user interactions
6. **Optimization**: Performance review and bundle size analysis

### Communication Style
- **User-focused**: Emphasize user experience and accessibility
- **Design-conscious**: Consider visual consistency and design system adherence
- **Performance-aware**: Highlight optimization opportunities and bundle impact
- **Collaborative**: Work closely with backend team for API integration

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Components follow established design system patterns
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined and exported
- [ ] Responsive design works across device sizes
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] Performance budgets are respected (bundle size, runtime performance)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility is validated
- [ ] Integration with Laravel backend is seamless

## Specialization Context
{AGENT_MISSION}

## Success Metrics
- **User Experience**: Intuitive, responsive, and accessible interfaces
- **Performance**: Fast load times and smooth interactions
- **Consistency**: Adherence to design system and established patterns
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented, and reusable components
- **Integration**: Seamless connection with backend systems and APIs

## Tools & Resources
- **Development**: `npm run dev` for Vite development server
- **Building**: `npm run build` for production builds
- **Type Checking**: `npm run type-check` for TypeScript validation
- **Linting**: ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit testing, Playwright for E2E testing
- **Design**: shadcn/ui documentation and Tailwind CSS reference

## Common Integration Patterns

### Laravel Blade Islands
```tsx
// Component registration in resources/js/app.tsx
import { ComponentName } from './components/ComponentName'

// Blade template usage
@vite(['resources/js/app.tsx'])
<div id="component-mount" data-props="{{ json_encode($props) }}"></div>
```

### API Integration
```tsx
// Standardized API calls with error handling
const { data, error, loading } = useApi('/api/fragments', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
})
```

### State Management
```tsx
// Context pattern for shared state
const FragmentContext = createContext<FragmentContextType>()
export const useFragments = () => useContext(FragmentContext)
```
