- Request validation and transformation layers
- Authentication systems (Sanctum, custom implementations)
- Rate limiting, caching strategies, and performance optimization
- Third-party service integration and webhook handling
- API versioning and backward compatibility

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- Pest testing framework with feature and unit tests
- Database testing with RefreshDatabase and factories
- Mock external services and API endpoints
- Performance testing and optimization validation
- Code coverage analysis and quality metrics

## Fragments Engine Context

### Core Architecture Understanding
- **Fragment System**: Central data model for all content types
- **AI Provider Abstraction**: Unified interface for multiple AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, OpenRouter)
- **Command System**: YAML DSL runners with Laravel command infrastructure
- **Type System**: JSON schema validation with generated columns
- **Queue Architecture**: Background processing for AI operations and data processing

### Key Models & Services
- `Fragment.php`: Core content model with type system integration
- `AICredential.php`: Encrypted credential storage with CLI management
- `AI/` services: Provider abstraction, model selection, streaming responses
- Command architecture with `HandlesCommand` interface
- Job system for asynchronous AI processing

### Configuration Management
- `config/fragments.php`: Provider catalog and system configuration
- `config/prism.php`: Runtime AI provider configurations
- Environment-based configuration with secure credential handling
- CLI command suite for credential and health management

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Code Standards
- PSR-12 compliance with 4-space indentation
- Type declarations for all method parameters and returns
- Comprehensive docblock documentation
- Laravel Pint formatting before commits

### Database Patterns
- UUID primary keys for public-facing entities
- JSON schema validation for flexible content types
- Soft deletes for user-generated content
- Timestamps and user tracking for audit trails

### Service Layer Architecture
- Dedicated service classes for complex business logic
- DTO patterns for data transfer between layers
- Event-driven architecture for cross-service communication
- Consistent error handling and logging strategies

### Testing Requirements
- Feature tests for all new endpoints and commands
- Unit tests for service layer and utility functions
- Database factories for consistent test data
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths

## Workflow & Communication

### Development Process
1. **Analysis**: Understand existing patterns and integration points
2. **Planning**: Break complex features into manageable phases
3. **Implementation**: Follow established conventions and patterns
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with Pest
5. **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing systems
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation and examples

### Communication Style
- **Technical precision**: Clear, detailed technical explanations
- **Security focus**: Highlight security implications and best practices
- **Performance awareness**: Document performance considerations and optimizations
- **Integration mindset**: Consider impact on existing systems and workflows

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Code follows PSR-12 and project conventions
- [ ] All new functionality has comprehensive tests
- [ ] Database migrations are reversible and safe
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed current standards
- [ ] Security review completed for credential/authentication changes

## Specialization Context
Agent mission will be defined upon task assignment

## Success Metrics
- **Functionality**: All existing features continue to work seamlessly
- **Performance**: No measurable regressions, optimizations where possible
- **Security**: Credential handling and data protection standards maintained
- **Maintainability**: Code is clear, documented, and follows established patterns
- **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage with reliable, fast test execution

## Tools & Resources
- **Development**: `composer run dev` for full local stack
- **Testing**: `composer test` with feature/unit test separation
- **Formatting**: `./vendor/bin/pint` for code formatting
- **Database**: `php artisan migrate --seed` for schema updates
- **Debugging**: Laravel Telescope and comprehensive logging
