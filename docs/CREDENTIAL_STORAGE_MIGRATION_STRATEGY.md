# Credential Storage Migration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for migrating credentials between different storage backends in the Fragments Engine, ensuring security, reliability, and minimal user disruption.

## Migration Scenarios

### 1. Database to Browser Keychain Migration

**Target Users:**
- Web application users with compatible browsers
- Users seeking enhanced security through biometric authentication
- Development teams wanting to reduce server-side credential exposure

**Prerequisites:**
- HTTPS/secure context required
- Browser with WebAuthn/Credential Management API support
- User device with biometric authentication capability
- User consent for keychain access

**Migration Process:**

#### Phase 1: Preparation and Validation
1. **Browser Capability Assessment**
   ```bash
   php artisan ai:credentials:storage-status --backend=browser_keychain
   ```
   - Verify WebAuthn API availability
   - Check biometric authentication support
   - Validate secure context requirements
   - Assess browser-specific limitations

2. **User Consent and Education**
   - Present keychain benefits (hardware-backed security, biometric access)
   - Explain migration process and requirements
   - Obtain explicit user consent
   - Provide option to defer migration

3. **Credential Inventory**
   ```bash
   php artisan ai:credentials:migrate --from=database --to=browser_keychain --dry-run
   ```
   - Identify credentials eligible for migration
   - Check for provider-specific requirements
   - Validate credential integrity and accessibility
   - Estimate migration complexity and duration

#### Phase 2: Migration Execution
1. **Secure Credential Export**
   - Retrieve credentials from database storage
   - Maintain encryption during transfer process
   - Validate credential completeness and integrity
   - Create secure temporary storage if needed

2. **Browser Keychain Setup**
   - Initialize WebAuthn authenticator
   - Create device-bound credential store
   - Establish encryption key derivation
   - Configure biometric authentication

3. **Credential Import**
   - Store credentials in browser keychain with user authentication
   - Encrypt credential data using Web Crypto API
   - Associate credentials with provider metadata
   - Verify successful storage and accessibility

4. **Verification and Testing**
   - Test credential retrieval using biometric authentication
   - Validate credential functionality with AI providers
   - Confirm metadata preservation and integrity
   - Execute end-to-end functionality tests

#### Phase 3: Cleanup and Configuration
1. **Database Cleanup** (Optional)
   - Mark database credentials as migrated
   - Optionally remove database credentials after confirmation
   - Update storage backend preference
   - Create migration audit trail

2. **Configuration Updates**
   ```bash
   # Update environment configuration
   CREDENTIAL_STORAGE_DEFAULT=browser_keychain
   CREDENTIAL_STORAGE_BROWSER_KEYCHAIN_ENABLED=true
   ```

### 2. Browser Keychain to Database Migration (Rollback)

**Scenarios:**
- Browser compatibility issues
- Corporate policy requirements
- User preference changes
- Technical difficulties with keychain access

**Migration Process:**

#### Rollback Preparation
1. **Access Verification**
   - Confirm biometric authentication still works
   - Verify credential accessibility in keychain
   - Check database storage availability
   - Prepare rollback authorization

2. **Credential Export from Keychain**
   - Authenticate user via biometric methods
   - Retrieve all stored credentials from browser keychain
   - Decrypt credential data securely
   - Validate credential completeness

#### Rollback Execution
1. **Database Storage**
   ```bash
   php artisan ai:credentials:migrate --from=browser_keychain --to=database
   ```
   - Re-encrypt credentials using Laravel Crypt
   - Store credentials in database with appropriate metadata
   - Preserve migration history and audit trail
   - Update storage backend configuration

2. **Verification**
   - Test database credential functionality
   - Verify AI provider connectivity
   - Confirm complete credential restoration
   - Update user preferences and configuration

### 3. Cross-Device Migration Strategy

**Challenge:**
Browser keychain credentials are device-bound and cannot be directly transferred between devices.

**Solution Approaches:**

#### Approach 1: Hybrid Storage Model
- Store non-sensitive metadata in database
- Use keychain only for sensitive credential data
- Enable cross-device metadata synchronization
- Require re-authentication on new devices

#### Approach 2: QR Code Transfer
- Export credentials from source device via QR code
- Encrypt QR code data with user-provided passphrase
- Import credentials on target device with passphrase
- Destroy temporary QR code data after transfer

#### Approach 3: Cloud Backup with User Encryption
- Allow user to create encrypted backup
- Store backup in user-controlled cloud storage
- Require user passphrase for backup decryption
- Import backup on new device with authentication

## Migration Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Backup and Recovery

**Automatic Backups:**
```bash
# Create backup before migration
php artisan ai:credentials:backup --provider=all --format=encrypted
```

**Recovery Procedures:**
```bash
# Restore from backup if migration fails
php artisan ai:credentials:restore --backup-file=credentials_backup_20241205.enc
```

### 2. Integrity Verification

**Pre-Migration Checks:**
- Validate all credentials are accessible
- Check credential expiration dates
- Verify provider connectivity
- Confirm storage backend availability

**Post-Migration Validation:**
- Test each migrated credential
- Verify metadata preservation
- Confirm functionality with AI providers
- Validate audit trail completeness

### 3. Rollback Triggers

**Automatic Rollback Conditions:**
- Migration failure rate > 50%
- Critical credential inaccessibility
- Storage backend unavailability
- User-initiated cancellation

**Manual Rollback Process:**
```bash
php artisan ai:credentials:migrate --rollback --migration-id=<migration_id>
```

## Enterprise Migration Considerations
