# Keychain Integration Foundation - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the completed implementation of ENG-07-03: Keychain Integration Foundation, which establishes the foundational architecture for transitioning from database-only credential storage to a flexible, multi-backend credential storage system that will support browser keychain and native keychain integration.

## Completed Deliverables

- Supports store, retrieve, update, delete, list operations
- Includes metadata management and health monitoring
- Provides capability detection and availability checking

**Key Methods:**
- `store()` - Store credentials with options and metadata
- `retrieve()` - Get credentials by ID with security validation
- `update()` - Modify existing credentials with audit trail
- `delete()` - Remove credentials (supports soft delete)
- `list()` - Enumerate credentials with provider filtering
- `isAvailable()` - Check backend availability
- `getCapabilities()` - Report backend feature support
- `getHealthStatus()` - Comprehensive status reporting

### 4. Configuration System ✅

**Enhanced fragments.php Configuration**
```php
'credential_storage' => [

    'preference_order' => ['native_keychain', 'browser_keychain', 'database'],
    'backends' => [
        'database' => ['enabled' => true, 'encryption' => 'laravel_crypt'],
        'browser_keychain' => ['enabled' => false, 'require_biometric' => false],
        'native_keychain' => ['enabled' => false, 'require_biometric' => true],
    ],
    'migration' => ['auto_migrate' => false, 'backup_before_migration' => true],
    'security' => ['audit_operations' => true, 'require_user_consent' => true],
]
```

### 5. Console Commands ✅

**CredentialStorageStatus** (`app/Console/Commands/AI/CredentialStorageStatus.php`)
- Comprehensive status reporting for all storage backends
- JSON output support for programmatic access
- Backend-specific detailed status information
- Configuration validation and health checks

**MigrateCredentialStorage** (`app/Console/Commands/AI/MigrateCredentialStorage.php`)
- Interactive migration between storage backends
- Dry-run capability for safe testing
- Progress tracking and error reporting
- Rollback and recovery procedures

**Enhanced CredentialsSet Command**
- Integrated with storage manager for backend selection
- Support for `--storage` option to specify backend
- Automatic fallback to available backends
- Storage capability validation before operations

### 6. Browser Keychain Foundation ✅

**Detection Utilities** (`resources/js/lib/keychain/detection.ts`)
- Comprehensive browser capability detection
- WebAuthn and Credential Management API support checking
- Biometric authentication availability detection
- Browser-specific limitation and recommendation reporting

**KeychainManager Interface** (`resources/js/lib/keychain/KeychainManager.ts`)
- TypeScript interfaces for credential storage operations
- Abstract base classes for storage implementations
- Error types and handling for keychain operations
- Storage selection and management utilities

**BrowserKeychainStorage Stub** (`resources/js/lib/keychain/BrowserKeychainStorage.ts`)
- Stub implementation for future browser keychain integration
- Method signatures matching CredentialStorageInterface
- Feature detection and availability checking
- Documentation for future implementation

### 7. Service Provider Integration ✅

**CredentialStorageServiceProvider** (`app/Providers/CredentialStorageServiceProvider.php`)
- Registers CredentialStorageManager as singleton service
- Automatically registers console commands
- Integrated with Laravel service container

### 8. Database Migration ✅

**ai_credentials Table**
- Created with proper schema for credential storage
- Includes provider, credential_type, encrypted_credentials fields
- Supports metadata JSON storage and expiration tracking
- Proper indexing for performance optimization

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Backward Compatibility

# Credential creation with storage selection
php artisan ai:credentials:set openai --storage=database
# Result: Successful storage with new abstraction layer

# Credential listing with storage backend info
php artisan ai:credentials:list
# Result: Enhanced display showing storage backend
