async function getOptimalCredentialStorage() {
    if (await isBrowserKeychainSupported() && userPrefersBrowserKeychain()) {
        return new BrowserKeychainStorage();
    }
    
    if (await isNativeKeychainAvailable()) {
        return new NativeKeychainStorage();
    }
    
    return new DatabaseCredentialStorage(); // Always available fallback
}
```
