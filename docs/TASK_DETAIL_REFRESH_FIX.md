# Task Detail Modal Refresh Fix

## Status: ✅ FIXED

## Original Issue
After assigning a sprint or agent to a task, the UI wasn't updating to show the new assignment, even though:
- The API call succeeded
- The backend updated the database
- `onRefresh()` was being called
- The data was being re-fetched

## Secondary Issue Discovered
After initial fix, `/orch-task 73` threw error:
```
The attribute [description] either does not exist or was not retrieved for model [App\Models\OrchestrationTask]
```

This was caused by:
1. Missing `description` column on `orchestration_tasks` table
2. Code trying to access non-existent fields on OrchestrationTask model
3. WorkItem/OrchestrationTask dual-model handling in TaskOrchestrationService

## Root Cause
React wasn't detecting that the `task` prop had changed because:
1. The `viewStack` state was being updated with new data
2. BUT the component wasn't re-rendering because React uses reference equality
3. Even though the array was updated `[...prev.slice(0, -1), refreshedResult]`, React didn't detect a meaningful change in the rendered output

## Solution
Added a `key` prop to force React to remount the component when data changes:

```typescript
// In CommandResultModal.tsx
const viewKey = `${viewStack.length}-${currentView.data?.task?.updated_at || Date.now()}`
return <div key={viewKey}>{renderComponent(currentView, stackHandlers, isOpen)}</div>
```

The key is composed of:
- `viewStack.length` - ensures key changes when navigating
- `updated_at` timestamp - ensures key changes when task is updated
- Fallback to `Date.now()` if no timestamp available

## Additional Improvements

### Backend: Enhanced Task Detail Response
Added missing fields to `TaskOrchestrationService::detail()`:
- `description` - task description
- `estimate_text` - time estimate
- `tags` - task tags array
- `agent_recommendation` - recommended agent
- `assignee_type` - type of assignee (agent, user, etc.)

### Frontend: Enhanced Logging
Added console logs to track the refresh flow:
- When refresh is called
- When new data is received
- When viewStack is updated
- When component is rendered with new key

## How It Works Now

1. **User assigns sprint/agent**
   - Click "Assign Sprint" or "Assign Agent" button
   - Modal opens with available options
   - User selects an option

2. **Save & Update**
   - `handleSaveField()` sends PATCH request to `/api/orchestration/tasks/{id}/field`
   - Backend updates the database
   - Returns 200 OK

3. **Refresh Flow**
   - `handleSaveField()` calls `onRefresh()`
   - `onRefresh` triggers `refreshCurrentView()` in CommandResultModal
   - Re-executes the original command (e.g., `/orch-task 73`)
   - Backend returns fresh data with updated `sprint_code`, `assignee_name`, `updated_at`

4. **React Re-render**
   - `setViewStack()` updates with new result
   - Component key changes because `updated_at` changed
   - React unmounts old TaskDetailModal
   - React mounts new TaskDetailModal with fresh data
   - UI displays updated sprint_code and assignee_name

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps
1. Run `/orch` to see sprint list
2. Click on a sprint to see task list
3. Click on a task to see task detail
4. Click "Assign Sprint" button
   - Verify modal opens with sprint list
   - Select a different sprint
   - Verify sprint_code updates in UI immediately
5. Click "Assign Agent" button
   - Verify modal opens with agent list
   - Select an agent
   - Verify assignee_name updates in UI immediately

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Sprint assignment updates instantly in UI
- ✅ Agent assignment updates instantly in UI
- ✅ No page refresh needed
- ✅ Works from both drill-down path (`/orch` → sprint → task) and direct path (`/orch-task 73`)

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `resources/js/islands/chat/CommandResultModal.tsx`
  - Added key prop based on `updated_at` timestamp
  - Enhanced logging for debugging

### Backend  
- `app/Services/TaskOrchestrationService.php`
  - **Removed WorkItem support** - now uses `OrchestrationTask` exclusively
  - Fixed field access to use direct model properties instead of metadata
  - Fixed `detail()` response to include correct fields
  - Removed references to non-existent fields (`recommended_agent`, etc.)

- `app/Models/OrchestrationTask.php`
  - Added `description` to `$fillable` array

### Database
- `database/migrations/2025_10_15_035307_add_description_to_orchestration_tasks_table.php`
  - Added `description` column (text, nullable) to `orchestration_tasks` table

## Related Issues
- Assign Sprint modal implementation
- Assign Agent modal implementation
- Modal navigation stack system
- Event bubbling prevention in nested modals

## Related Documentation
- See `ORCHESTRATION_TASK_DESCRIPTION_MIGRATION.md` for details on WorkItem removal and description field addition

## Future Improvements
- Consider using React Query for automatic cache invalidation
- Add optimistic updates for instant UI feedback
- Consider websocket/polling for real-time updates from other users
- Add `description` field to task creation/edit forms
