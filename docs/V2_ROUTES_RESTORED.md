# V2 Page Routes Restoration - Complete

## What Was Done

### 1. Fixed ComponentRegistry Export
- Added `export { registry as componentRegistry }` to `ComponentRegistry.ts`
- Fixes the import error in `ComponentRenderer.tsx`

### 2. Created V2 Entry Point
- Created `resources/js/v2/main.tsx` - bootstraps React and registers all components
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to include `resources/js/v2/main.tsx` as entry point
- Updated `resources/views/v2/shell.blade.php` to use `@vite('resources/js/v2/main.tsx')`

### 3. Fixed V2ShellController
- Changed from Inertia to regular Blade view
- Passes `pageKey`, `isAuthenticated`, `hasUsers`, `user` to view

### 4. Added API Route
- Added `GET /api/v2/ui/pages/{key}` to `routes/api.php`
- Points to `V2\UiPageController@show`

### 5. Restored Missing Controller
- Restored `app/Http/Controllers/SeerLogController.php` from backup

### 6. Created Test Page
- Created `page.test.simple` with registered components (typography.h2, button, badge)
- Configured as modal overlay

## How to Test

### 1. Build Assets
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Start Laravel Server
```bash
php artisan serve
```

### 3. Test Pages in Browser

**Test Page (Simple Components):**
```
http://localhost:8000/v2/pages/page.test.simple
```
Should show a modal with:
- H2 heading: "Hello UI Builder v2!"
- Button: "Click Me"
- Badge: "New"

**Agent Table Page (Complex - needs work):**
```
http://localhost:8000/v2/pages/page.agent.table.modal
```
Will show "Unknown component type: search.bar" and "Unknown component type: table" because these components haven't been built yet.

**Model Table Page (Complex - needs work):**
```
http://localhost:8000/v2/pages/page.model.table.modal
```
Same as agent table - needs search.bar and table components.

### 4. Test API Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/ui/pages/page.test.simple | jq
```

## What's Working

✅ V2 route infrastructure (web + API)
✅ ComponentRegistry with 56 registered primitive/layout/composite components
✅ V2ShellPage React component
✅ ComponentRenderer with fallback for unknown types
✅ Modal/Sheet/Page overlay support
✅ Build process with v2/main.tsx entry point

## What's Missing

❌ `search.bar` component (referenced in agent/model pages)
❌ `table` component (referenced in agent/model pages)
❌ Data fetching/binding logic for table components
❌ Form submission logic for create modals

## Next Steps

To make the agent and model pages work, you need to:

1. **Create SearchBarComponent** (`resources/js/components/v2/composites/SearchBarComponent.tsx`)
2. **Create TableComponent** (`resources/js/components/v2/advanced/TableComponent.tsx`) 
3. **Register them** in ComponentRegistry
4. **Implement data binding** for the dataSource property
5. **Implement action handlers** for buttons/forms

Or, update the page configs to use simpler registered components for initial testing.
