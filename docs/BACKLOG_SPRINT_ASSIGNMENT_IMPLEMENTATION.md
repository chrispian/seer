# Backlog & Sprint Assignment Implementation

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: Complete  
**Branch**: feature/config-driven-navigation-v2

---

## Summary

Implemented backlog management and sprint/agent assignment modals with keyboard-driven combobox interface.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Removed Unassigned Tasks from Sprints
- Removed `fetchUnassignedTasks()` from `Sprint/ListCommand.php`
- Cleaned up `SprintListModal.tsx` to remove virtual "UNASSIGNED" sprint
- Removed unassigned filter option

### 2. Added `/backlog` Command
- Created `/backlog` slash command with full table view
- Uses `BacklogListModal.tsx` (custom wrapper, following `/sprints` pattern)
- Priority-first sorting, then by creation date
- Filters: Priority (high/medium/low), Assignment status
- Shows content availability badges (`has_content` object)
- Row clicks open task detail modal

**Backend**: `app/Commands/Orchestration/Backlog/ListCommand.php`
**Frontend**: `resources/js/components/orchestration/BacklogListModal.tsx`
**Database**: Added to `commands` table via `CommandsSeeder.php`

### 3. Send to Backlog Button
- Added one-click "Send to Backlog" button in `TaskDetailModal`
- Sets `status = 'backlog'` via existing field update API
- Button shows "In Backlog" when task is already in backlog (disabled)
- Auto-refreshes view after status change

### 4. Assign Sprint Modal (Combobox)
- New `AssignSprintModal.tsx` using shadcn Command component
- Shows all available sprints with status badges and task counts
- Full keyboard navigation: search, arrow keys, Enter to select, ESC to close
- Auto-focuses search input on open
- Highlights current sprint assignment
- Integrated with "Assign" button next to Sprint field in TaskDetailModal

### 5. Assign Agent Modal (Combobox)
- New `AssignAgentModal.tsx` with same combobox pattern
- Includes "Unassign" option to clear agent assignment
- Shows agent status badges
- Highlights current agent assignment
- Integrated with "Assign" button next to Agent field in TaskDetailModal

## Architecture Pattern: Custom Modal Wrappers

**Current Standard** (as of Oct 2025):
All list commands should use **custom modal wrappers** that extend `DataManagementModal`:

```
/sprints    → SprintListModal    (custom wrapper)
/backlog    → BacklogListModal   (custom wrapper)
/tasks      → TaskListModal      (custom wrapper)
```

**Why Custom Wrappers:**
- Provides full control over filters, chips, actions
- Allows view-specific customizations (progress bars, badges, sorting)
- Maintains consistency until Module System (Phase 2) is ready

**Generic `DataManagementModal`** is used as fallback for simple views or when custom features aren't needed (e.g., `/bookmarks`).

**Future**: Module System will replace custom modals with schema-driven configuration (see `docs/MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md`).

---

## Technical Decisions

### Navigation Config Required
All commands using `DataManagementModal` (directly or via wrapper) must define `navigation_config` with `data_prop`:

```json
{
  "data_prop": "tasks",
  "item_key": "task_code",
  "detail_command": "/task-detail"
}
```

This tells the system:
- Which property in the result contains the array data
- Which field to use as the item key for navigation
- Which command to execute when clicking a row

### Null Safety in Search/Filters
Fixed `DataManagementModal` to handle `null`/`undefined` values in search and filter operations:
- Search: `value != null && String(value).toLowerCase()`
- Filters: `itemValue == null || String(itemValue) !== filterValue`
- Title: `title?.toLowerCase() || 'items'`

### Component Name Resolution
Added `BacklogListModal` to component name checks:
```typescript
if (componentName.includes('Task') || componentName.includes('Backlog')) {
  props.onTaskSelect = (item) => executeDetailCommand(...)
}
```

**Frontend:**
- `resources/js/components/orchestration/SprintListModal.tsx` - Removed unassigned sprint
- `resources/js/components/orchestration/BacklogListModal.tsx` - Already existed, verified
- `resources/js/components/orchestration/TaskDetailModal.tsx` - Added buttons and modals
- `resources/js/components/orchestration/AssignSprintModal.tsx` - **Created**
- `resources/js/components/orchestration/AssignAgentModal.tsx` - **Created**
- `resources/js/components/ui/DataManagementModal.tsx` - Null safety fixes
- `resources/js/islands/chat/CommandResultModal.tsx` - Added backlog handler, title prop

## Testing Checklist

- [x] `/backlog` loads with priority-sorted tasks
- [x] Backlog rows clickable to open task detail
- [x] "Send to Backlog" button in task detail works
- [x] "Assign Sprint" button opens combobox modal
- [x] Sprint search and keyboard navigation works
- [x] "Assign Agent" button opens combobox modal
- [x] Agent search and keyboard navigation works
- [x] Unassign option in agent modal works
- [x] All modals close with ESC
- [x] Audit logs created for all changes

## Known Issues / Technical Debt

**Ticket 10** logged in `delegation/tasks/SPRINT-TASK-ENHANCEMENTS.md`:
- Custom modals (`BacklogListModal`, `TaskListModal`, `SprintListModal`) are temporary
- Module System (Phase 2) will replace with schema-driven columns
- Low priority until Module System is implemented
- Estimated effort: 8-12 hours when Phase 2 starts

**Cache Confusion:**
- CommandRegistry caches for 1 hour
- Database changes require `php artisan cache:clear` or `CommandRegistry::clearCache()`
- Hard browser refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) required after frontend builds

## Next Steps

Remaining enhancements from SPRINT-TASK-ENHANCEMENTS.md:
1. Sortable table columns (2-3h)
2. Sprint content tabs (3-4h)
3. Unassigned tasks filter (2h) - **May be obsolete now**
4. Next/Prev navigation in detail modals (6-8h, needs architecture)
5. Enhanced clipboard with formatted output (1h)
6. Polish pass (2-3h)

Total remaining: ~16-23 hours
