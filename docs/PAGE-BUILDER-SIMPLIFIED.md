# Page Builder - Simplified Analysis

## Component Availability

### ✅ Available
- `accordion` - YES
- `tabs` - YES  
- `card` - YES
- `data-table` - YES
- `button` - YES (primitive)
- `typography` - YES
- `textarea` - YES

### ❌ Not Components (Likely Layout Types)
- `rows` - Not a component, used as layout type
- `columns` - Not a component, used as layout type
- `form` - Not registered as component

## The Issue

The page builder config uses `rows`/`columns` and `form` which aren't registered components. These might be:

1. **Layout types** (in layout.type field) - not actual components
2. **Frontend-only** constructs that don't need database registration
3. **Missing** from the component registry

## Simplified Approach

Since `form` isn't a registered component, we have two options:

### Option A: Use Basic Components
Replace form fields with individual components:
- `input` (text fields)
- `select` (dropdowns)
- `textarea` (multi-line)
- `button` (submit)

### Option B: Check if Forms Work Without Registration
The frontend might support `form` as a special type even if not in database.

## Recommendation

**Let's test the current config as-is** and see what breaks. The frontend DataTableComponent and other React components might support layout types (`rows`, `columns`) and form components even if they're not in the database registry.

The database registry might be for:
- **Visual components** (buttons, inputs, cards)
- **Data components** (data-table, charts)

But **layout primitives** (`rows`, `columns`) and **container concepts** (`form`) might be built into the frontend framework.

## Next Step

Seed the page and test it. We'll discover:
1. Which "components" are actually just layout types
2. Whether form works without registration
3. What errors we get

Then we can adapt the config based on what actually works.
