# Sprint 40 Planning â€“ Fragments Engine

## Team & Cadence
- Coordinator: Codex (planning/sprint-40 branch)
- Type System Lead: Priya
- Slash Command Lead: Malik
- Scheduler Lead: Jordan
- Inbox Lead: Sofia
- Observability Lead: Eli
- Check-ins: async updates as tasks complete or blockers appear; surface cross-stream dependencies immediately.

## Working Notes
- Use unified diffs for all edits.
- Follow existing implementation patterns; request clarification on ambiguities.
- Honor precedence rules for shared loaders (types, command packs) and keep schema changes backwards compatible where feasible.
