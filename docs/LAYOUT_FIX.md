## Layout Structure Fix

The layout issue was caused by improper flex behavior in the chat area:

### Problem:
- ChatTranscript with `flex-1` was expanding to fill all available space
- No proper spacing between ChatTranscript and ChatComposer
- Content was overflowing the container bounds

### Solution:
- ChatIsland: `flex flex-col h-full` (removed gap-1)
- ChatTranscript container: `flex-1 min-h-0 mb-2` (proper flex with spacing)
- ChatTranscript component: `h-full` (controlled height)
- ChatComposer container: `flex-shrink-0` (prevents compression)

### Result:
- ChatTranscript fills available space but stops before ChatComposer
- Proper 8px margin (mb-2) between transcript and composer
- No overflow or layout distortion
- Maintains responsive design
