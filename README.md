# Fragments Engine

**Fragments Engine** is an intelligent knowledge capture and recall system designed for rapid thought logging, AI-augmented reflection, and seamless information discovery. Built for ADHD-friendly, frictionless knowledge management.

## ‚ú® Core Concept

**Fragments** are atomic units of knowledge - thoughts, tasks, meeting notes, ideas, or any piece of information you want to capture and later recall. The system intelligently processes, enriches, and organizes these fragments, making them instantly discoverable when you need them.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Type Detection**: Automatically categorizes notes, tasks, meetings, ideas
- **Tag Suggestions**: Intelligent tagging based on content analysis

### ‚ö° **Instant Recall System**
- **Ctrl+K Command Palette**: Global shortcut for instant fragment access
- **Advanced Search Grammar**: `type:meeting #urgent @person has:link before:2024-12-01`
- **Intelligent Ranking**: Hybrid algorithm combining relevance, recency, and popularity

## ‚å®Ô∏è Interface Overview

### Command Palette (Ctrl+K)
The heart of Fragments Engine - instant access to your entire knowledge base:

```
üîç Search: meeting with client
üìã Results:
  [Meeting] Client Project Kickoff - 2 days ago
  [Task] Follow up on client feedback - 1 week ago  
  [Note] Client requirements document - 3 weeks ago

üí° Quick Filters:
  type:meeting    Filter by fragment type
  #urgent         Filter by tags
  @john.doe      Filter by people mentions
  has:link       Has attachments or links
```

### Slash Commands
Quick actions within the chat interface:

- `/frag add [content]` - Create a new fragment
- `/recall [query]` - Search and recall fragments  
- `/search [terms]` - Advanced search with grammar
- `/vault [name]` - Switch workspace context
- `/project [name]` - Set project scope

### Search Grammar
Powerful query language for precise fragment discovery:

```bash
# Basic search
meeting notes client discussion

# Type filtering
type:todo urgent tasks
type:meeting #client

# Tag combinations  
#urgent #project -#completed
#meeting OR #call

# People and mentions
@john.doe project updates
@team.lead OR @manager

# Content filters
has:link documentation
has:code deployment scripts
has:attachment presentations

# Date and time
today meeting notes
yesterday #standup
this week project updates
before:2024-12-01 quarterly review
after:2024-11-15 #retrospective

# Advanced combinations
type:meeting @client #urgent before:2024-12-31 has:link
```

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Fragment Processing Pipeline
Every fragment goes through intelligent processing:

1. **Capture** ‚Üí Raw input from user
2. **Parse** ‚Üí Extract structure and meaning
3. **Enrich** ‚Üí Add metadata, entities, context
4. **Classify** ‚Üí Determine type and importance  
5. **Route** ‚Üí Organize into appropriate vault/project
6. **Index** ‚Üí Make searchable and discoverable

### Intelligent Features

#### Auto-Entity Extraction
```
Input: "Meeting with @john.doe tomorrow. Email slides to team@company.com"

Extracted:
- People: ["john.doe"]  
- Emails: ["team@company.com"]
- Dates: ["tomorrow"]
- Type: "meeting"
- Suggested Tags: ["meeting", "presentation"]
```

#### Smart Title Generation
```
"Call client about urgent project deadline by Friday"
‚Üí Title: "Client Call - Project Deadline"

"Remember to: 1) Update docs 2) Deploy staging 3) Email team"  
‚Üí Title: "Task: Update docs, deploy staging, email team"
```

#### Context-Aware Search
- **Session Context**: Prioritizes fragments from current conversation
- **Vault Scoping**: Searches within relevant workspace  
- **Recent Activity**: Boosts recently accessed or created content
- **Selection Learning**: Learns from your choices to improve ranking

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Vector Embeddings & Semantic Search

Fragments Engine supports optional vector embeddings for semantic search capabilities. This feature can be toggled on/off and gracefully falls back to text-based search when disabled.

#### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Enable/disable vector embeddings (default: false)
EMBEDDINGS_ENABLED=true

# Embeddings provider (openai, ollama)
EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=openai

# OpenAI embedding model
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small

# Embeddings version for cache invalidation
EMBEDDINGS_VERSION=1
```

#### Database Requirements

- **PostgreSQL**: Requires `pgvector` extension for vector storage
- **SQLite/MySQL**: Falls back to text-only search automatically

#### Management Commands

```bash
# Backfill embeddings for existing fragments
php artisan embeddings:backfill

# Dry run to see what would be processed
php artisan embeddings:backfill --dry-run

# Process in smaller batches
php artisan embeddings:backfill --batch=50

# Force execution without confirmation
php artisan embeddings:backfill --force

# Use specific provider/model
php artisan embeddings:backfill --provider=ollama --model=nomic-embed-text
```

#### How It Works

When embeddings are **enabled**:
- New fragments automatically generate vector embeddings
- Search uses hybrid scoring (text relevance + semantic similarity)
- Results include similarity scores and enhanced ranking

When embeddings are **disabled**:
- No embedding jobs are queued
- Search falls back to full-text search only
- UI clearly indicates "text-only search" mode
- No performance or functionality degradation
