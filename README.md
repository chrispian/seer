# SEER

**SEER** (Self-Evolving External Reflection) is a cognitive tool for rapid personal logging, thought capture, and AI-augmented self-awareness.

Fragments (log entries) are:
- Added via CLI
- Categorized and tagged
- Queried via `recall`, `search`, and AI sorting (coming soon)

SEER is built in Laravel with a MySQL backend and CLI-first ergonomics. The core loop is designed for ADHD-friendly, frictionless journaling and knowledge capture.

## Example

```bash
fragment todo "Wash truck before Friday" chores urgent,vehicle
flist
fsearch truck
```

## Coming Soon

- AI-powered tagging and sorting
- Real-time CLI reflection
- Obsidian & Markdown sync
- Encrypted/private mode
