# Modal Navigation Stack - Completion Summary

## ✅ FIXED - Commit: 313baec

**Issue:** Multi-layer modal navigation ESC key handling broken  
**Root Cause:** Stale closure in React useEffect ESC handler  
**Solution:** Ref-based pattern to avoid stale closures + capture phase event listeners  

## The Problem We Solved

When navigating through modal layers (Sprints List → Sprint Detail → Task Detail), pressing ESC would close the modal instead of going back one layer. This was caused by the ESC key handler capturing old prop values in its closure.

### Symptoms
- ✅ Task Detail ESC worked (went to Sprint Detail)
- ❌ Sprint Detail ESC closed modal (should go to Sprints List)  
- ❌ Sprints List ESC closed modal (correct, but inconsistent behavior)

### Debug Journey
1. Initially thought it was event propagation issue
2. Found multiple ESC handlers competing
3. Discovered stale closure via debug logs: `onBack exists? false` after re-render
4. Identified useEffect dependencies not triggering handler recreation in time

## The Fix

### Backend Changes
```php
// Commands now return component + config
return $this->respond($data, 'TaskDetailModal');
```

### Frontend Changes  
```typescript
// Use ref to avoid stale closure
const onBackRef = useRef(onBack)
useEffect(() => { onBackRef.current = onBack }, [onBack])

// ESC handler always has fresh value
const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
  if (e.key === 'Escape') {
    if (onBackRef.current) {
      onBackRef.current()  // ← Always latest
    } else {
      onClose()
    }
  }
}
// Capture phase to run before Dialog
document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown, { capture: true })
```

## Files Changed

### Backend (4 files)
1. `app/Commands/BaseCommand.php` - Added ui_base_renderer config
2. `app/Commands/Orchestration/Sprint/DetailCommand.php` - Use respond()
3. `app/Commands/Orchestration/Task/DetailCommand.php` - Use respond()
4. `app/Models/Command.php` - Added ui_base_renderer fillable
5. `database/migrations/2025_10_11_010948_add_ui_base_renderer_to_commands_table.php` - New migration

### Frontend (4 files)
1. `resources/js/islands/chat/CommandResultModal.tsx` - Navigation stack implementation
2. `resources/js/components/ui/DataManagementModal.tsx` - **Ref-based ESC handler (THE FIX)**
3. `resources/js/components/orchestration/SprintDetailModal.tsx` - Pass onBack prop
4. `resources/js/components/orchestration/TaskDetailModal.tsx` - Use onBack in Dialog

## How It Works Now

### Navigation Flow
```
/sprints (stack: [])
  → Click sprint (stack: [SprintDetail])
    → Click task (stack: [SprintDetail, TaskDetail])
      → ESC → Back to Sprint Detail (stack: [SprintDetail])
        → ESC → Back to Sprints List (stack: [])
          → ESC → Close modal
```

### Button Behavior
- **ESC Key**: Navigate back one layer (close if on root)
- **Back Button**: Navigate back one layer (close if on root)
- **X Button**: Close modal entirely from any layer
- **Close Button**: Close modal entirely from any layer

## Testing Checklist ✅

All scenarios verified working:
- [x] ESC on root (Sprints List) closes modal
- [x] ESC on Sprint Detail goes to Sprints List
- [x] ESC on Task Detail goes to Sprint Detail  
- [x] X button closes from any layer
- [x] Close button closes from any layer
- [x] Back button navigates back correctly
- [x] Stack resets when modal closes
- [x] Reopening modal shows fresh root view

## Key Learnings

### React Patterns
1. **Refs for Event Handlers** - When props change but handler shouldn't recreate
2. **Capture Phase** - Use `{ capture: true }` to intercept before library handlers
3. **Stale Closures** - useEffect dependencies must include ALL used values OR use refs
4. **Event Listener Timing** - Multiple handlers = race conditions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Single Stack State** - viewStack array in CommandResultModal
2. **Prop Drilling** - onBack passed through component hierarchy
3. **Conditional Logic** - onBack exists? navigate : close
4. **Stack Reset** - useEffect clears stack when modal closes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not blocking):
1. Extract navigation logic to custom hook
2. Consider React Router for modal navigation (hash-based)
3. Add keyboard shortcuts for layer jumps (Cmd+1, Cmd+2)
4. Implement breadcrumb navigation UI
5. Add animation transitions between layers

## Rubber Duck Debugging Credit

This fix was discovered through systematic debugging with help from two sub-agents who:
1. Identified the stale closure root cause
2. Suggested the ref-based pattern solution
3. Recommended capture phase event interception

The breakthrough came from analyzing debug logs showing `onBack exists? false` immediately after a re-render that should have passed `onBack: true`.
